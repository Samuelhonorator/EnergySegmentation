%    \item A two-stage stochastic mixed complementarity capacity investment model with CO2 trading markets.

 %   \item CO2 markets for allowance allocation and allowance re-trading with endogenous price determination.

%\item Current Chilean GHG intensity pledge does not drive an important shift in the future Chilean electric mix.

%\item A more stringent carbon budget can result in carbon prices approximately ten times higher than the current price.

%\item Achieving emissions reduction goal does not necessarily results in phasing out coal in the longer term.
