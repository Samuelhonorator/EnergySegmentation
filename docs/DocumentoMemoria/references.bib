	abstract = {We present a model of information acquisition in a competitive market in which traders can learn both from costly (and diverse) private enquiry and price, which costlessly (but partially) reveals the total amount of information known to all traders. Our major purpose is to show that an equilibrium exists in such a market: that is, there exists a rational expectations competitive equilibrium in which the amount of costly diverse information each trader acquires is endogenously determined. From this result we investigate the change in the informativeness of price relative to changes in the level of noise, the cost of acquiring information, and the distribution of traders' risk preferences.},

	abstract = {Constraint integer programming (CIP) is a novel paradigm which integrates constraint programming (CP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and satisfiability (SAT) modeling and solving techniques. In this paper we discuss the software framework and solver SCIP (Solving Constraint
Integer Programs), which is free for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. This paper gives
an overview of the main design concepts of SCIP and how it can be used to solve constraint integer programs. To illustrate
the performance and flexibility of SCIP, we apply it to two different problem classes. First, we consider mixed integer programming
and show by computational experiments that SCIP is almost competitive to specialized commercial MIP solvers, even though SCIP
supports the more general constraint integer programming paradigm. We develop new ingredients that improve current MIP solving
technology. As a second application, we employ SCIP to solve chip design verification problems as they arise in the logic
design of integrated circuits. This application goes far beyond traditional MIP solving, as it includes several highly non-linear
constraints, which can be handled nicely within the constraint integer programming framework. We show anecdotally how the
different solving techniques from MIP, CP, and SAT work together inside SCIP to deal with such constraint classes. Finally,
experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for proving the validity of properties
on circuits containing arithmetic.},

This paper addresses that argument and concludes that cap-and-trade will need to be accompanied by complementary regulatory measures. While it is a necessary component in a climate mitigation programme, it is unlikely to be sufficient by itself to accomplish the desired emission reductions. The paper reviews the evidence on how SO2 emissions were reduced and the extent to which actual emission trading was responsible for the reduction as opposed to other innovations. It also identifies differences between the past regulation of SO2 and other air pollutants and the challenges presented by the regulation of GHG emissions. What actually happened in the US with SO2 emission trading deviated in several significant respects from what would be predicted based on the conventional theoretical analysis. While there was a dramatic reduction in SO2 emissions, it occurred because of several factors, some of which are unlikely to apply for GHG emissions, and others of which argue for an activist regulatory policy by the government as a complement to the functioning of an emissions market for GHGs.},

It permeates such disparate fields as microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, public economics, and industrial organization. It enables us to think in a rather consistent way about behavioral biases, speculate about their origins, and trace out their implications for market outcomes. This survey first discusses the most basic models of attention, using a fairly unified framework. Then, it discusses the methods used to measure attention, which present a number of challenges on which a great deal of progress has been achieved, although much more work needs to be done. It then examines the various theories of attention, both behavioral and more Bayesian. It finally discusses some applications. For instance, inattention offers a way to write a behavioral version of basic microeconomics, as in consumer theory and Arrow–Debreu. A last section is devoted to open questions in the attention literature. This chapter is a pedagogical guide to the literature on attention. Derivations are self-contained.},

The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation.

Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical ESGefficient frontier and show the costs and benefits of responsible investing.

While a standard model of oligopolistic for-profit competition predicts a positive relationship between market size and firm size, our analogous model of competition between prosocially motivated charities predicts no such correlation. If charities are biased towards their own provision, a positive association between market size and provider size can arise. We examine these predictions empirically for six different local charity markets. Our empirical findings suggest that charities do not solely pursue prosocial objectives, and that increased competition in the charity sector can lead to rationalization in provision.},

Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin elasticity of about − 0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of − 0.1, yielding a total elasticity of about − 0.3. To further explore the extensive-margin response, we propose a model with a fixed cost of declaring donations and obtain a structural estimate of that cost of around £47. We also study the welfare effects of tax incentives, extending the theoretical literature to allow for extensive-margin giving and for a fixed cost of declaring donations.

This paper investigates the at-work allocation of time among teaching, research, grant writing and service by science and engineering faculty at top US research universities. We focus on the relationship between tenure (and promotion) and time allocation, and we find that tenure and promotion do affect the allocation of time. The specific trade-offs are related to particular career paths. For example, full professors spend increasing time on service at the expense of teaching and research while longer-term associate professors who have not been promoted to full professor spend significantly more time teaching at the expense of research time. Finally, our results suggest that women, on average, allocate more hours to university service and less time to research than do men.},

	abstract = {Cleantech venture capital investment differs from the typical venture capital investment in that it tends to be very capital intensive and faces greater technology risks associated with the functioning of the technology, scalability and exit requirements than the typical venture capital investment. Moreover, unlike the typical venture capital investment, the benefits arising from cleantech cannot be totally captured by the venture capitalist as many of its benefits accrue to society via reduced environmental degradation and better health and quality of life outcomes. The public goods literature posits that such externalities reduce investment in cleantech below the socially optimal level. We seek to determine whether there are countervailing factors which may incite greater cleantech investment. We argue that oil prices, increased stakeholder attention, as well as the impact of various formal and informal institutions are such factors. This paper provides a cross-country analysis of the determinants of cleantech venture capital investment with a unique worldwide dataset of 31 countries spanning 1996–2010. The data show consistent evidence of a pronounced role for oil prices in driving cleantech venture capital deals, which is more important than other economic, legal or institutional variables. Cleantech media coverage is likewise a statistically significant determinant of cleantech venture capital investment and as economically significant as other country level legal, governance, and cultural variables. Uncertainty avoidance has a negative impact on cleantech venture capital investment, as well as a moderating effect on other variables.},

Three of these have been chosen here to illustrate the general point: The theory of taxation and risk taking with focus on portfolio choice, the role of uncertainty in public expenditure analysis (emphasising the effect of public goods provision on private risk taking) and the theory of tax evasion and compliance.},

UPC has the same undominated perfect equilibria as standard provision point (PPM) and proportional rebate (PR) mechanisms, and UPA a somewhat broader set. However, our mechanisms' different marginal penalty structures may facilitate equilibrium selection and lead to higher contributions and more frequent provision. Through laboratory experiments, using both homogeneous (symmetric) and heterogeneous induced values, we show our mechanisms improve upon PR and PPM: UPC generates higher aggregate contributions than PR and PPM, leading to higher provision rates than PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions, although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high offers are more common (especially among high value people in the heterogeneous environment) in the uniform price mechanisms, where higher offers only increase the payment when needed for provision.},

High sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information.

We establish general comparative statics results regarding the effect of specific changes in the distribution of beliefs on the (unique) Nash equilibrium provision of the public good, under certain conditions imposed on the preferences. We specifically show that the equilibrium public good provision is increasing with respect to both first- and second-order stochastic dominance changes in the distribution of beliefs. Hence, increasing the contributors' optimism about the uncertain benefit of their contributions increases aggregate public good provision, as does any homogenization of these beliefs around their mean.},

We also look at the legal institutions that determine (and are determined by) the relationship between public and private actors. Policy measures to institutionalize rewards in a way that promote more equitable public–private partnerships can be understood as attempts to mediate asymmetric power relations, tensions and conflicting views among multiple stakeholders, as well as building a shared notion of the value and legitimacy of the role of the state. We conclude by outlining analytical and policy implications and identifying avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Haavelmo (1944) proposed a probabilistic structure for econometric modeling, aiming to make econometrics useful for decision making. His fundamental contribution has become thoroughly embedded in econometric research, yet it could not answer all the deep issues that the author raised. Notably, Haavelmo struggled to formalize the implications for decision making of the fact that models can at most approximate actuality. In the same period, Wald (1939, 1945) initiated his own seminal development of statistical decision theory. Haavelmo favorably cited Wald, but econometrics did not embrace statistical decision theory. Instead, it focused on study of identification, estimation, and statistical inference. This paper proposes use of statistical decision theory to evaluate the performance of models in decision making. I consider the common practice of 
              as‐if optimization 
              : specification of a model, point estimation of its parameters, and use of the point estimate to make a decision that would be optimal if the estimate were accurate. A central theme is that one should evaluate as‐if optimization or any other model‐based decision rule by its performance across the state space, listing all states of nature that one believes feasible, not across the model space. I apply the theme to prediction and treatment choice. Statistical decision theory is conceptually simple, but application is often challenging. Advancing computation is the primary task to complete the foundations sketched by Haavelmo and Wald.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Web surveys are frequently based on samples drawn from panels with large amounts of nonresponse or haphazard selection. The availability of large-scale consumer and voter databases provides large amounts of auxilliary information for both panelists and population members. Sample matching, where a conventional random sample is selected from a population frame and the clos-est matching respondent from the panel is selected for interviewing, is proposed. It is shown that under suitable assumptions (primarily ignorability of panel membership conditional upon the match-ing variables), the resulting survey estimates are consistent with an asymptotic normal distribution. Simulation results show that the matched sample estimators are superior to weighting a random sub-sample from the panel and have a similar sampling distribution to simple random sampling from the population. In an example involving the 2006 U.S. Congressional elections, estimates using sample matching from an opt-in Web panel outperformed estimates based on phone interviews with RDD samples. 1.},

Geared to theoretical statisticians and practitioners alike, the book discusses all topics from the ground up and clearly explains the relation of the prediction approach to the traditional design-based randomization approach. Key features include: * Special emphasis on linking survey sampling to mainstream statistics through extensive use of general linear models * A liberal use of simulation studies, numerical examples, and exercises illustrating theoretical results * Numerous statistical graphics showing simulation results and properties of estimates * A library of S-Plus computer functions plus six real populations, available via ftp * Over 260 references to finite population sampling, linear models, and other relevant literature},

We find that scope and measurement divergence are the main drivers, while weights divergence is less important. In addition, we detect a rater effect where a rater's overall view of a firm influences the assessment of specific categories.},

Doing so, I show that equilibrium is restored for a non-degenerate set of unimodal distributions. In addition, the equilibria have the following features: (1) the left-most and right-most candidates (i.e., extremists) are idealists; (2) strategic candidates never share their policy platforms, which instead are spread out across the policy space; and (3) if more than one strategic candidate enters, the distribution of voter preferences must be asymmetric.

	abstract = {This study presents the spatial analysis of walking accessibility to a public facility in a hilly, multi-level urban environment. Our spatial database includes street topography, physical impedances, formal crossings, and designated access points in assessing the network distance of all private residential buildings to public open space in Hong Kong. Pedestrian movement of uneven speed on walkways of varying gradients is assessed. The study concludes that, compared with our method, conventional buffer analysis and network distance analysis over-estimate the walking accessibility of private housing to neighbourhood open space in Hong Kong by about 2–8\%. Despite Hong Kong’s compact built environment, about 15\% of the total number of residential blocks cannot reach a neighbourhood open space within 5 minutes of walking (equivalent to the local planning standard of 400 metres of walking on a flat terrain). These open space-deficient neighbourhoods comprise mostly the affluent or middle-class households in gated housing estates and in low-rise housing, but also some neighbourhoods of underprivileged families in old urban tenement buildings. Our assessment reveals the spatial bias of land use planning policy leading to these blackspots of open space shortfall in the territory. It requires urban planners to pay attention to the geographical barriers of a pedestrian network in redressing the inequitable distribution and achieving a pedestrian-friendly 3D city.},

Three studies examined who shows overconfidence and why. Study 1 demonstrated that participants with an entity (fixed) theory of intelligence, those known to avoid negative information, showed significantly more overconfidence than those with more incremental (malleable) theories. In Study 2, participants who were taught an entity theory of intelligence allocated less attention to difficult problems than those taught an incremental theory. Participants in this entity condition also displayed more overconfidence than those in the incremental condition, and this difference in overconfidence was mediated by the observed bias in attention to difficult problems. Finally, in Study 3, directing participants' attention to difficult aspects of the task reduced the overconfidence of those with more entity views of intelligence. Implications for reducing biased self-assessments that can interfere with learning were discussed.},

Surprisingly, there is little consistency and transparency in preprocessing steps, making replicability and reproducibility difficult. To increase replicability, reproducibility, and transparency, a package in R (a free and widely used statistical programming environment) called gazeR was created to read and preprocess two types of data: gaze position and pupil size. For gaze position data, gazeR has functions for reading in raw eye-tracking data, formatting it for analysis, converting from gaze coordinates to areas of interest, and binning and aggregating data. For data from pupillometry studies, the gazeR package has functions for reading in and merging multiple raw pupil data files, removing observations with too much missing data, eliminating artifacts, blink identification and interpolation, subtractive baseline correction, and binning and aggregating data. The package is open-source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/dmirman/gazer.

	abstract = {Measurement of pupil size (pupillometry) has recently gained renewed interest from psychologists, but there is little agreement on how pupil-size data is best analyzed. Here we focus on one aspect of pupillometric analyses: baseline correction, i.e., analyzing changes in pupil size relative to a baseline period. Baseline correction is useful in experiments that investigate the effect of some experimental manipulation on pupil size. In such experiments, baseline correction improves statistical power by taking into account random fluctuations in pupil size over time. However, we show that baseline correction can also distort data if unrealistically small pupil sizes are recorded during the baseline period, which can easily occur due to eye blinks, data loss, or other distortions. Divisive baseline correction (corrected pupil size = pupil size/baseline) is affected more strongly by such distortions than subtractive baseline correction (corrected pupil size = pupil size − baseline). We discuss the role of baseline correction as a part of preprocessing of pupillometric data, and make five recommendations: (1) before baseline correction, perform data preprocessing to mark missing and invalid data, but assume that some distortions will remain in the data; (2) use subtractive baseline correction; (3) visually compare your corrected and uncorrected data; (4) be wary of pupil-size effects that emerge faster than the latency of the pupillary response allows (within ±220 ms after the manipulation that induces the effect); and (5) remove trials on which baseline pupil size is unrealistically small (indicative of blinks and other distortions).},

	abstract = {Pupillometry has been one of the most widely used response systems in psychophysiology. Changes in pupil size can reflect diverse cognitive and emotional states, ranging from arousal, interest and effort to social decisions, but they are also widely used in clinical practice to assess patients’ brain functioning. As a result, research involving pupil size measurements has been reported in practically all psychology, psychiatry, and psychophysiological research journals, and now it has found its way into the primatology literature as well as into more practical applications, such as using pupil size as a measure of fatigue or a safety index during driving. The different systems used for recording pupil size are almost as variable as its applications, and all yield, as with many measurement techniques, a substantial amount of noise in addition to the real pupillometry data. Before analyzing pupil size, it is therefore of crucial importance first to detect this noise and deal with it appropriately, even prior to (if need be) resampling and baseline-correcting the data. In this article we first provide a short review of the literature on pupil size measurements, then we highlight the most important sources of noise and show how these can be detected. Finally, we provide step-by-step guidelines that will help those interested in pupil size to preprocess their data correctly. These guidelines are accompanied by an open source MATLAB script (available at https://github.com/ElioS-S/pupil-size). Given that pupil diameter is easily measured by standard eyetracking technologies and can provide fundamental insights into cognitive and emotional processes, it is hoped that this article will further motivate scholars from different disciplines to study pupil size.},

With increased competition in electric power markets, system operators are recognizing their pivotal role in ensuring the efficient operation of the electric grid and the maximization of social welfare. In this article, we propose a hypothetical new market of dynamic spatial network equilibrium among consumers, system operators and electricity generators as solution of a dynamic Stackelberg game. In that game, generators form an oligopoly and act as Cournot-Nash competitors who non-cooperatively maximize their own profits. The market monitor attempts to increase social welfare by intelligently employing equilibrium congestion pricing anticipating the actions of generators. The market monitor influences the generators by charging network access fees that influence power flows towards a perfectly competitive scenario. Our approach anticipates uncompetitive behavior and minimizes the impacts upon society. The resulting game is modeled as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). We present an illustrative example as well as a stylized 15-node network of the Western European electric grid.},

These rankings are the opposite of the rankings of prices, total output, surplus, and profits under perfect information. We also show that the first n−1 firms’ expected profits form a decreasing sequence from the first to the (n−1)st in the Stackelberg game. The last mover earns more expected profit than the first mover if n≤4, or the ratio of the signals’ informativeness to the prior certainty is sufficiently low. Lastly, there is a discontinuity between the Stackelberg equilibrium of the perfect information game and the limit of Stackelberg perfect revealing equilibria, as the noise of the demand information of firms vanishes to zero at the same rate. We provide various robustness checks for the results when the precision of signals are asymmetric, there is public information or cost/quality uncertainty, or the products are differentiated.},

	abstract = {In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, countries worldwide are transforming their energy systems with higher shares of renewable energy and smart technologies for demand response. Microgrids play an essential role in the transformation of electric grids to smart grids. However, renewable sources present new challenges, particularly those of high variability, which creates uncertainties in the supply side that can affect the security of electricity access at affordable prices. This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg stochastic model to account for different sources of uncertainty. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) with uncertainty regarding the availability of wind and solar sources and electricity prices. Availability of renewable sources is modeled via chance constraints, which allows assessing the risk of microgrids over-committing supply levels. Uncertainty in electricity prices is modeled via a set of demand scenarios with a given probability distribution. The lower-level problem of the Stackelberg problem considers an electricity dispatch problem for each demand scenario. The proposed model allows measuring the strategic actions of microgrids when facing different types of uncertainties and how the smart grid should adapt to guarantee that demand levels are supplied. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We find that microgrids risk levels above 30\% do not correlate with further benefits, such as reduced electricity prices. We also identified that in average, depending on the social cost of carbon and demand level, microgrids can cover their own demand and supply 15\% of the electricity demand in the grid.},

It has been conjectured that Action Independence can be behaviorally characterized by means of a suitable no-betting condition (Dekel and Siniscalchi, 2015), but whether this is indeed the case remains an open problem. In this paper, we prove this conjecture true by focusing on strategy-invariant bets, which are bets that cannot be manipulated by the players. In particular, first, we show that at least one of the common priors satisfies Action Independence if and only if there exists no mutually acceptable strategy-invariant bet among the players. Second, we show that, all common priors satisfy Action Independence if and only if there exists no mutually acceptable strategy-invariant bet among the players and an outside observer. These results give us a deeper understanding of existing foundations of solution concepts using only epistemic conditions that are expressed in terms of type structures and are therefore elicitable.},

	abstract = {This paper studies an equilibrium model between an insurance buyer and an insurance seller, where both parties’ risk preferences are given by convex risk measures. The interaction is modeled through a Stackelberg type game, where the insurance seller plays first by offering prices, in the form of safety loadings. Then the insurance buyer chooses his optimal proportional insurance share and his optimal prevention effort in order to minimize his risk measure. The loss distribution is given by a family of stochastically ordered probability measures, indexed by the prevention effort. We give special attention to the problems of self-insurance and self-protection, and show that if the buyer’s risk measure decreases faster in effort than his expected loss, optimal effort is non-decreasing in the safety loading with a potential discontinuity when optimal coverage switches from full to zero. On the contrary, if the decrease of the buyer’s risk measure is slower than the expected loss, optimal effort may or may not be non-decreasing in the safety loading. In case of Pareto distributed losses, the seller sets the highest possible price under which the buyer still prefers full insurance over no insurance. We also analyze the case of discrete distributions: on the one hand, for self-protection, under the assumption that the marginal impact of the effort is higher on small losses than it is on catastrophic losses, the optimal effort is non-decreasing in the safety loading. On the other hand, in the case of self-protection, more conditions are needed, in particular, we obtain sufficient conditions for the optimal effort to be non-decreasing or non-monotone in the safety loading.},

These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.},

We find little evidence for information aggregation and dissemination in early rounds. Nonetheless, after traders gain experience with the market mechanism and structure, prices converge to reveal the true state of the world. Elicited post-market beliefs reveal that markets are able to efficiently aggregate dispersed information even if individual traders remain uninformed, consistent with the marginal trader hypothesis.},

Here, we conducted two experiments to investigate whether human gifting behavior and brain activity are affected by inequity aversion. In experiment 1, participants played as a responder in a joint donation game in which they were asked to decide whether or not to accept a donation proposal made by the proposer. In experiment 2, participants played a donation game similar to experiment 1, but the charity projects were classified as high-deservingness and low-deservingness projects. The results in both of two experiments showed that the participants were more likely to reject an unfair donation proposal and the late positivity potential (LPP)/P300 elicited by fair offers was more positive than moderately unfair and highly unfair offers regardless of charity deservingness. Moreover, after principal component analysis, the differences in P300 amplitude between fair and highly unfair conditions were positively correlated with the acceptance rates in experiment 2. Taken together, our study revealed that late positivity (LPP/P300) reflected the evaluation of fairness of proposals, and could predict subsequent pro-social decisions. This study is the first to demonstrate that inequity aversion reduces pro-social motivation to help innocent third party.},

Secondly, cap-and-trade system is more efficient to reduce emission and to promote clean innovation than carbon tax. Finally, firms undertake a loss under carbon tax, while the effects of cap-and-trade system on firms' profits are uncertain, which depends on the carbon cap. In summary, this article supports cap-and-trade system to cope with global climate change, but the regulator should choose the suitable emission cap and carbon trading price to guarantee the efficiency of cap-and-trade system.

	abstract = {Green credit financing (GCF) is a type of financial service provided by banks to encourage borrowers to commit green investment and achieve sustainable development. This study investigates a supply chain system consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a well-funded supplier facing uncertain demand, in which the manufacturer may seek GCF from banks. An important prerequisite for obtaining a green loan is that the borrower must make green upgrades and ensure compliance with pre-specified environmental standards. We design a GCF model for a supply chain by imposing a hard constraint on carbon emissions. To determine the effectiveness of GCF, we conduct an in-depth analysis comparing the GCF with traditional trade credit financing (TCF), in which excessive carbon emissions are penalized. The optimal equilibrium solutions under GCF and TCF mode are obtained and their sensitivities to key parameters analyzed. Concerning the preferences of the two financing strategies, we find that under a relatively strict carbon emission policy, the manufacturer can set an appropriate green investment range to achieve a win-win situation with the supplier. Finally, we compare the social welfare of the supply chain for the different financing modes and find that there are regions in which both the social welfare and profit of the manufacturer can be a win-win. The government can guide manufacturers to make a win-win choice by setting different carbon caps.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study choice under growing awareness in the wake of new discoveries. The decision maker's behavior is described by two preference relations, one before and one after new discoveries are made. The original preference admits a subjective expected utility representation. As awareness grows, the original decision problem expands and so does the state space. Therefore, the decision maker's original preference has to be extended to a larger domain, and consequently the new preference might exhibit ambiguity aversion. We propose two consistency notions that connect the original and new preferences. Unambiguity Consistency requires that the original states remain unambiguous while new states might be ambiguous. This provides a novel interpretation of ambiguity aversion as a systematic preference to bet on old states than on newly discovered states. Likelihood Consistency requires that the relative likelihoods of the original states are preserved. Our main results axiomatically characterize a maxmin expected utility (MEU) representation of the new preference that satisfies the two consistency notions. We also extend our model by allowing the initial preference to be MEU, and characterize reverse full-Bayesianism, which is an extension of the reverse Bayesianism of Karni and Vierø (2013) to MEU preferences.},

However, increased interest in and justification of the use of more engaged pedagogy that blends in class and online learning to reach a new and diverse generation of college students makes it imperative that we, as instructors, understand who is best served by such teaching innovations. In this paper, I present student outcome results from an informal post hoc experiment conducted over four semesters in which an Introductory Economics course is taught in its entirety three times over two semesters using traditional lecture methods and then three times over two subsequent semesters using a flipped-group pedagogy. In the latter, approximately 70\% of class time is devoted to completion of graded in-class group assignments and the majority of content is delivered out of class through a series of publicly available videos. Results from the analysis indicate that in this particular context, the benefits of the flipped-grouped classroom pedagogy were not distributed equally. Specifically, while students with more developed math literacy and non-minority students benefited from the flipped pedagogy as evidenced by higher performance on the third semester exam and, to a lesser extent, on the averaged semester exams, the flipped format had a negative impact on weaker and minority students.},

This higher order thinking is necessary for students to answer fundamental questions in economics. The primary advantage of the blend and flip format is that students can achieve low levels of learning, memorization of terms, and mastery of simple applications of concepts on their own before meeting for a face-to-face class. Previous research confirms that students in flipped-blended classes show larger gains in learning than students in moderately-blended classes. However, the gains we find are modest compared to those reported in related research in the math and science disciplines, which use research-based teaching practices, proven in the cognitive science literature. We determine the effects of using research-based instructional strategies on student learning in principles of microeconomics courses. Specifically, after controlling for a number of key background variables, we test whether students in flipped-blended classes who learn with research-based strategies in face-to-face classes are capable of applying knowledge and skills better than their counterparts in flipped-blended classes who are assigned practice problems similar to those on exams during face-to-face classes. Our findings indicate that students exposed to RBIS show significantly greater learning gains than students in the control group, and that these gains are most prevalent in the later part of the semester.},

Three cap-and-trade mechanisms are considered, No cap-and-trade Mechanism (NM), Grandfathering Mechanism (GM), and Benchmarking Mechanism (BM). We find that the utility firm invests more in renewable energy under either a GM or a BM than that under NM. As compared to GM, the utility firm under the BM invests more in renewable energy, while at the same time it generates more carbon emissions. We also show that investment in renewable energy does not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. When the government sets the unit carbon quota appropriately, however, BM can not only achieve a reduction in carbon emissions, but also ensure that electricity demand will not decrease. The implementation of BM can make the utility firm invest most heavily in renewable energy, while the implementation of GM will produce the lowest carbon emissions. When either a GM or a BM implemented under a lenient unit carbon quota (or total carbon quota), the utility firm can be more profitable. The study provides some new management insights for the policy-maker.},

In Modica and Rustichini (1994) we showed a difficulty in the project, namely that without weakening of the inference rules of the logic one would face the unpleasant alternative between full awareness and full unawareness. In this paper we study a logical system where non full awareness is possible, and prove that a satisfactory solution to the problem can be found by introducing limited reasoning ability of the subject. A determination theorem for this system is proved, and the appearance of partitional informational structures with unawareness is analysed.Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: D80, D83.},

Using two donation types (donation-for-gift/charity sale) and two product types (hedonic/utilitarian), this research discusses how charities should frame product-for-money activities toward enhancing compliance and re-donation intentions upon receiving product donations. Two 2 (donation types) by 2 (product types) between-subject experiments are conducted in college campus cafeterias. The first study uses an inspiring cause while the second study provides a scenario designed to evoke sympathy. Results show that donation-for-gift garners higher donation intentions compared to charity sale, as explained by the dual-process model. It is also revealed that product type moderates the influence of donation type on donation intention only when a sympathetic appeal is used. The fitting issue between product type and cause appeal, along with the licensing effect are presented to explain this finding.},

Students perceived a higher degree of achievement of the learning goals in both flipped courses compared to the non-flipped active learning course. Moreover, participating in the partial or full flipped classroom decreased the odds of a D or F grade or of withdraw. However, only the partial flip was associated with overall better learning outcomes in the final exam, while there was no statistically significant difference between the non-flipped active learning course and the full flip. Age was negatively associated with learning outcomes and increased the odds of a D or F grade or of withdraw. Gender had no statistically significant impact on learning outcomes. Students were least satisfied with the full flip and equally satisfied with the non-flipped active learning course and the partial flip. Lower satisfaction appears to be due to increased workload, which students evaluated to be highest in the full flip, as well as to elements of group work design. In the flipped classroom design, the pre-class multiple choice tests on Moodle emerged as a clear favorite in students’ teaching evaluations.},

The empirical results show that CTA DMs that include an incentive have a higher positive impact on customer's purchase probability compared with those without an incentive. Furthermore, non-monetary incentives, especially utilitarian ones, have a higher positive impact than monetary incentives. Our results also show that customer heterogeneity plays an important role in the influence of CTA DMs on purchase incidence. More specifically, CTA DMs have a higher impact on purchase incidence for customers with higher past purchase frequency, lower purchase recency, longer relationship duration and for customers who received DM more recently and frequently. The results of the study provide valuable insights for managers allocating their direct marketing budget: it is better to use non-monetary (preferably utilitarian) incentives and to target customers based on relationship history as well as DM history.},

Notably, however, they were largely insensitive to the percentage of payment allocated to charity—customers paid little more when 99\% of the payment went to charity than when only 1\% went to charity. Neither self-selection nor social pressure fully explained higher payments under SSR.

Also, donation calls that only state the development problem the project is addressing result in larger donations than donation calls providing additional information on the project’s impact. Analyzing the mechanisms behind these results, the data shows that, regardless of the framing, providing information about a project’s impact increases individuals’ knowledge and perception of effectiveness. But, while higher perceived effectiveness results in larger donations, increased knowledge lowers them - resulting in a zero net effect of additional information on donations.

In this research, we use a nationwide sample of high school students from Chile to investigate how these factors interact on a systemic level. Confirming prior research, we find that family income is a strong predictor of achievement. Extending prior research, we find that a growth mindset (the belief that intelligence is not fixed and can be developed) is a comparably strong predictor of achievement and that it exhibits a positive relationship with achievement across all of the socioeconomic strata in the country. Furthermore, we find that students from lower-income families were less likely to hold a growth mindset than their wealthier peers, but those who did hold a growth mindset were appreciably buffered against the deleterious effects of poverty on achievement: students in the lowest 10th percentile of family income who exhibited a growth mindset showed academic performance as high as that of fixed mindset students from the 80th income percentile. These results suggest that students’ mindsets may temper or exacerbate the effects of economic disadvantage on a systemic level.},

	abstract = {Up to now, the potential of eye tracking in science as well as in everyday life has not been fully realized because of the high acquisition cost of trackers. Recently, manufacturers have introduced low-cost devices, preparing the way for wider use of this underutilized technology. As soon as scientists show independently of the manufacturers that low-cost devices are accurate enough for application and research, the real advent of eye trackers will have arrived. To facilitate this development, we propose a simple approach for comparing two eye trackers by adopting a method that psychologists have been practicing in diagnostics for decades: correlating constructs to show reliability and validity. In a laboratory study, we ran the newer, low-cost EyeTribe eye tracker and an established SensoMotoric Instruments eye tracker at the same time, positioning one above the other. This design allowed us to directly correlate the eye-tracking metrics of the two devices over time. The experiment was embedded in a research project on memory where 26 participants viewed pictures or words and had to make cognitive judgments afterwards. The outputs of both trackers, that is, the pupil size and point of regard, were highly correlated, as estimated in a mixed effects model. Furthermore, calibration quality explained a substantial amount of individual differences for gaze, but not pupil size. Since data quality is not compromised, we conclude that low-cost eye trackers, in many cases, may be reliable alternatives to established devices.},

The mailing frequency is optimized using long-term objectives but restricts the decisions to the number of mailings to send to the individual over consecutive finite planning periods. A stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated for this problem that can easily be applied to various direct marketing frameworks such as catalog sales or charity organizations. The model is calibrated for a large Dutch non-profit organization and shows that substantial improvements can be achieved by approaching the mailing strategy with the mailing frequency problem, both in the number of mailings to send and in the profits resulting from the responses.},

This enhancement of the original DMLM-approach is called Dynamic Multidimensional Marketing (DMDM). With DMLM alone, Rhenania, a German direct mail order company, turned its catalog mailing practices around and consequently rose from the number 5 to the number 2 market position. The DMLM approach was so effective that two major competitors could be bought out. Improvements provided by DMDM were threefold: more efficient resource allocation across all catalog brands, more accurate customer microsegmentation, and more effective reactivation. Presently, the company's target is to transform single-brand customer relationships into two- or three-brand relationships with higher revenue per customer. As a consequence, the Rhenania group's performance was decoupled from the overall market trend.},

The authors investigate the impact of direct mailings on the revenues of each firm and its competitors over time. The model accounts for endogeneity of the mailing decision and for unobserved heterogeneity across households. The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities. In the long run, these effects die out. The results are also interpreted from a behavioral perspective.},

We find that optimizing the objective function over multiple periods as opposed to a single period leads to higher expected profits and expected utility.

Yet extant models ignore direct marketing efforts. Response models incorporate the effects of direct marketing, but because they ignore latent attrition, they may lead firms to waste resources on inactive customers. We propose a parsimonious model that allows direct marketing to impact three relevant behaviors in latent attrition models—the frequency with which customers conduct transactions, the size of the transactions, and the duration for which customers remain active. Our model also accounts for how the organization targets its direct marketing across individuals and over time. Using donation data from a nonprofit organization, we find that direct marketing increases donation incidence for active donors. However, our analysis also shows that direct marketing has the potential to shorten the length of a donor's relationship. We find that our proposed model offers superior predictive performance compared with models that ignore the impact of direct marketing activity or latent attrition. We demonstrate the managerial applicability of our modeling approach by estimating the impact of direct marketing on donation behavior and identifying those donors most likely to conduct transactions in the future.},

We investigate the effects of (1) various envelope characteristics and observable cues on opening rates, and (2) characteristics of the envelope content on the keeping rates of direct mail campaigns. We show that visual design elements on the outer envelope – rather than sender-related details – are the predominant drivers of opening rates. Factors such as letter length, provision of sender information in the letter, and personalization positively influence the keeping rate. We also observe that opening and keeping rates are uncorrelated at the campaign level, implying that opening direct mail pieces is only a necessary condition for responding to offers, but not per se a driver of direct mail response.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we look at the donation behavior of donors who periodically contribute a preset amount to a particular charity. The charity firm makes extensive use of direct mail to nurture these donors, and in fact sends two types of mails, one that seeks to retain the donors (retention-seeking mails) and the other requesting them to upgrade their donation amount (upgrade-seeking mails). We study the different effects of the two types of direct mail on the donation behavior. To these mails, a donor has to respond by making two decisions: “should I continue donating or not?” and “should I upgrade or not?” We propose a multi-response model that accommodates not only the differential effects of the two types of mail on the donors, but also the possible correlation across the two response functions for each donor. We fit our model to a very large data set to explore whether our model can extract the unique impact of demographics and those of the two types of mail on the two aspects of donation behavior. What makes it more interesting is that the charity firm deliberately uses the observed donation behavior of people to design the two types of mail. In our model and estimation, we explicitly account for this endogenous effect to ensure that we measure the unbiased impact of the two types of mail on the two responses of the donors. Our results show that once we account for the endogenous effect and separately model the effect of different types of mail on each type of donor response, we get a much clearer picture of the “true” effects of these mails, as opposed to a simpler model that does not incorporate these effects. Firms are advised to not only carefully analyze the donation behavior of the donors but also carry out simulation exercises to understand the effects of mails in totality before taking action.},

The results demonstrate a co-produced direct marketing communication strategy that increases attitude toward the communication, purchase intent, and purchase activity, while also acting as a risk-reducing mechanism. Furthermore, perceived customization of the communication interacts strongly with risk perception and marginally with coupon proneness as related to attitude toward the communication when marketers enter the world of consumers' personal media. A push versus pull framework and a co-produced communication framework are put forth to suggest various areas marketers can make available for consumers to co-produce in a marketing communication exchange.},

Previous research shows that, by optimizing the mailing frequency, organizations are able to distinguish their mailing from other mailings that donors receive. However, some organizations, such as blood services, struggle to convert the frequency recommendations into their marketing practice. As donation events occur irregularly and blood donors are only able to donate a certain number of times, mailing strategies have to result in blood donations. This study examines a strategy in which a reminder direct mailing follows the regular invitation a few days before a particular donation event. A field experiment was conducted with 396 donors; 203 received the double mailing. Surprisingly, the results from hierarchical binary logistic regressions do not reveal any differences between the experimental groups.

Bewley–Huggett– Aiyagari models are general equilibrium models with incomplete markets and idiosyncratic, but no aggregate, shocks. The algorithm itself is based on discretization, while the theory importantly allows for making simulations using the approximate computational solution of the value function problem rather than the true model solution. The numerical results of applying the algorithm to both models are provided and investigated in terms of replication, revealing that the Aiyagari model overestimates the degree of precautionary savings in the high-risk-and-high-risk-aversion case.

We find that pre-announcing a rise in the carbon tax rate could reduce CO2 emissions but would decrease output and investment during the interim period (between the announcement and implementation dates). Pre-announcing an increase in the carbon tax rate from 1\% to 5\%, 1 and 3 years in advance could reduce the quarterly aggregate consumption by 0.081\% and 0.114\%, respectively. Compared to carbon taxation, pre-announcing a tightening carbon intensity target could reduce CO2 emissions even more, while pre-announcing a tightening carbon capacity target under a cap-and-trade regime has no such CO2 reduction effect. In a welfare analysis, we show that an unanticipated rise in the carbon tax rate is more preferable to the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year-ahead announcements.

	abstract = {Dynamic non-luminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter have frequently been shown to be a reliable index for the level of arousal, mental effort, and activity in the locus coeruleus, the brainstem's noradrenergic arousal center. While pupillometry has most commonly been used to assess the level of arousal in particular psychological states or the level of engagement in cognitive tasks, some recent studies have found a relationship between average resting-state (i.e. baseline) pupil sizes and individuals' working memory capacity (WMC), indicating that individuals with higher WMC on average have larger pupils than individuals with relatively lower WMC. In the present study, we measured pupil size continuously in 212 participants during rest (i.e. while fixating) and estimated WMC in all participants by administering the Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) task from WAIS-III. We were unable to replicate the relation between average pupil size and WMC. However, the novel finding was that higher WMC was associated with higher variability in resting-state pupil size. The present results are relevant for the current debate on the role of noradrenergic activity on working memory capacity.},

First, we show that RI by itself creates an additional demand for robustness that leads to higher “induced uncertainty” facing consumers. Second, if we allow capacity to be elastic, RB increases the optimal level of attention. Third, we explore how the induced uncertainty composed of (i) model uncertainty due to RB and (ii) state uncertainty due to RI, affects consumption and wealth dynamics, the market price of uncertainty, and the welfare losses due to incomplete information. We find that induced uncertainty can better explain the observed consumption-income volatility and market price of uncertainty – low attention increases the effect of model misspecification.},

However, the relationship between pupil size and individual differences in cognitive ability is not as well studied. A peculiar finding that has cropped up in this research is that those high on cognitive ability have a larger pupil size, even during a passive baseline condition. Yet these findings were incidental and lacked a clear explanation. Therefore, in the present series of studies we systematically investigated whether pupil size during a passive baseline is associated with individual differences in working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Across three studies we consistently found that baseline pupil size is, in fact, related to cognitive ability. We showed that this relationship could not be explained by differences in mental effort, and that the effect of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence on pupil size persisted even after 23 sessions and taking into account the effect of novelty or familiarity with the environment. We also accounted for potential confounding variables such as; age, ethnicity, and drug substances. Lastly, we found that it is fluid intelligence, more so than working memory capacity, which is related to baseline pupil size. In order to provide an explanation and suggestions for future research, we also consider our findings in the context of the underlying neural mechanisms involved.},

The classical finite dimensional theory, the commodity space is the canonical finite dimensional linear space Rn. By contrast, there is no canonical infinite dimensional linear space. Different economic applications require models involving different infinite dimensional linear spaces. The mathematical discipline of functional analysis has already been well developed as a tool for the abstract study of linear spaces. The chapter follows the methodology of functional analysis and attacks the existence problem. Advantage of this method is that it yields general results, capable of application in a wide variety of specific models. An important line of research in classical general equilibrium theory has been the relationship of the core to the set of competitive allocations. In the infinite dimensional setting, an extensive body of work has been developed, which centers around the infinite-dimensional version of the Debreu–Scarf core convergence theorem.},

	abstract = {Summary: This addition to the ISOR series introduces complementarity models in a straightforward and approachable manner and uses them to carry out an in-depth analysis of energy markets, including formulation issues and solution techniques. In a nutshell, complementarity models generalize: a. optimization problems via their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions b. non-cooperative games in which each player may be solving a separate but related optimization problem with potentially overall system constraints (e.g., market-clearing conditions) c. economic and engineering problems that aren't specifically derived from optimization problems (e.g., spatial price equilibria) d. problems in which both primal and dual variables (prices) appear in the original formulation (e.g., The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) or its precursor, PIES). As such, complementarity models are a very general and flexible modeling format. A natural question is why concentrate on energy markets for this complementarity approach? As it turns out, energy or other markets that have game theoretic aspects are best modeled by complementarity problems. The reason is that the traditional perfect competition approach no longer applies due to deregulation and restructuring of these markets and thus the corresponding optimization problems may no longer hold. Also, in some instances it is important in the original model formulation to involve both primal variables (e.g., production) as well as dual variables (e.g., market prices) for public and private sector energy planning. Traditional optimization problems can not directly handle this mixing of primal and dual variables but complementarity models can and this makes them all that more effective for decision-makers.

The stabilization scheme employs a path-generation procedure which is used to construct a piecewise-linear path from the current point to the Newton point; a step length acceptance criterion and a non-monotone pathsearch are then used to choose the next iterate. The algorithm is shown to be globally convergent under assumptions which generalize those required to obtain similar results in the smooth case. Several imple?entation issues are discussed, and extensive computational results obtained from problems commonly found in the literature are given},

We also develop a sensitivity metric to quantify uncertainty propagation by determining the change in the variance of the output due to a change in the variance of an input parameter. The covariance matrix of the solution variables quantifies the uncertainty in the output and pairs correlated variables and parameters. The sensitivity metric helps in identifying the parameters that cause maximum fluctuations in the output. The method developed in this paper optimizes the use of gradients and matrix multiplications which makes it particularly useful for large-scale problems. Having developed this method, we extend the deterministic version of the North American Natural Gas Model (NANGAM), to incorporate effects due to uncertainty in the parameters of the demand function, supply function, infrastructure costs, and investment costs. We then use the sensitivity metrics to identify the parameters that impact the equilibrium the most.},

	abstract = {We cast models of the generation capacity expansion type formally developed for the monopoly regime into equilibrium models better adapted for a competitive environment. We focus on some of the risks faced today by investors in generation capacity and thus pose the problem as a stochastic equilibrium model. We illustrate the approach on the problem of the incentive to invest. Agents can be risk neutral or risk averse. We model risk aversion through the CVaR of plants' profit. The CVaR induces risk-adjusted probabilities according to which investors value their plants. The model is formulated as a complementarity problem (including the CVaR valuation of investments). An illustration is provided on a small problem that captures several features of today's electricity world: a choice often restricted to coal and gas units, a peaky load curve because of wind penetration, uncertain fuel prices, and an evolving carbon market. We assess the potential of the approach by comparing energy-only and capacity market organizations in this risky environment. Our results can be summarized as follows: a deterministic analysis overlooks some changes of capacity structure induced by risk, whether in the capacity market or energy-only organizations. The risk-neutral analysis also misses a shift towards less capital-intensive technologies that may result from risk aversion. Last, risk aversion also increases the shortage of capacity compared to the risk-neutral view in the energy-only market when the price cap is low. This may have a dramatic impact on the bill to the final consumer. The approach relies on mathematical programming techniques and can be extended to full-size problems. The results are illustrative and may deserve more investigation.},

The models are structured in a unified stochastic Nash game framework. Each model is the concatenation of a model of the short-term market operations (perfect competition or Cournot), with a long-term model of investment behavior (risk neutral and risk averse behavior under different assumptions of risk trading). The models can all be formulated as complementarity problems, some of them having an optimization equivalent. We prove existence of solutions and report numerical results to illustrate the relevance of market imperfections on welfare and investment behavior. The models are constructed and discussed as two stage problems but we show that the extension to multistage is achieved by a change of notation and a standard assumption on multistage risk functions. We also treat a large multistage industrial model to illustrate the computational feasibility of the approach.},

These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs. Development of new risk trading mechanisms to replace or complement current capacity obligations could lead to more efficient outcomes.},

Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90\% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More importantly, the large majority of studies reports positive findings. We highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP appears stable over time. Promising results are obtained when differentiating for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, regions, and young asset classes for ESG investing such as emerging markets, corporate bonds, and green real estate.},

The model includes oil as an input in multiple domestic sectors (consumption, intermediate goods, and transportation services). We include a domestic oil production sector for the United States to reflect the recent development in shale oil technology. The model also captures international trade in goods and oil. The model parameters are set through a combination of calibration and Bayesian estimation using quarterly data for 1991 through 2015. Baseline estimation of the model finds the elasticity of U.S. real GDP with respect to an oil price shock of − 0.015, which is among the less elastic estimates in the literature. Using the model to conduct counterfactual analysis, we find that decreasing steady state U.S. oil consumption substantially reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices. Increasing U.S. domestic oil production only modestly reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices.},

Still, our multi-sector analysis points to the importance of the origin of the shocks in the ranking of the two instruments and to the desirability of going beyond a single-sector analysis in evaluating their merits. We find no significant difference between the cap and the tax regimes when shocks come from non-energy sectors. In contrast, the cap has lower volatility but higher welfare costs than the tax for the shocks to energy production.},

To fully study the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of this policy, this paper establishes a dynamic country-level Compute General Equilibrium (CGE) model with the electricity sector disaggregated into 5 technologies and 19 major taxable pollutants included. Five scenarios are developed, including the baseline scenario BaU, the low environmental tax scenario LowET, the high environmental tax scenario HighET, the low environmental tax and low carbon tax scenario LowETC, and the high environmental tax and high carbon tax scenario HighETC. The simulation results show that the environmental tax could help reduce emissions of most kinds of pollutants but bring negative effects on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Compared to the BaU scenario, the GDP loss by 2030 would be 0.10\%, 0.21\%, 0.32\% and 0.67\% in the LowET, HighET, LowETC and HighETC scenarios. The emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2) will decrease by 3.55\%, 7.15\%, 6.70\% and 13.01\%, and the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) will be reduced by 2.21\%, 4.62\%, 8.91\% and 16.77\%.

We show how government expenditure, interest rate, and carbon tax rate should vary over time in order to stabilize carbon emission levels. We find that (i) while all the aforementioned policies could stabilize carbon emissions, their underlying mechanisms are different. Fiscal, monetary, and carbon tax policies, uniquely and respectively, lead to a reduction in abatement effort, income tax revenue, and general price level. (ii) With economic expansions driven by total factor productivity (TFP) shocks, fiscal policy is the only policy that could maintain the emission levels and simultaneously improve household welfare in term of consumption and labor. (iii) Regarding the interaction between carbon and macroeconomic policies, carbon taxation should complement monetary policy, while it should not respond to fiscal policy.},

	abstract = {This dissertation deals with the understanding of policies and interventions that foster human development, with a focus on children and youth, and to build a link between human development and a learning society by using an interdisciplinary approach. This thesis studies how individuals develop their learning capabilities as well as their creative, entrepreneurial, and socio-emotional skills. The dissertation is structured in three main chapters in addition to this brief introduction. The first chapter, "Affective Neuroscience meets Labor Economics: Assessing Non-Cognitive skills on Late Stage Investment on at-Risk Youth,” studies the role of a program designed to foster entrepreneurial and self-confidence through learning by failure using insights from micro-econometric, behavioral economics and applied neuroscience. The second chapter, "How Much Should We Trust Self-reported Measures of Non-cognitive Skills?,” explores the relation between transient emotional states and self-ratings on self-reported measures of socio-emotional skills using a behavioral and a neuro-physiological experiment. This chapter also works as a “proof of concept” of the methods —e.g. emotion-detection theory and lab-in-the-field experiments implemented on chapter 1. The third chapter, “Can Art-based Programs Nurture Human Capital? Evidence From Public Schools in Chile,” studies the impacts of an art-based program in high school in Chile following a quasi-experimental design using propensity score matching techniques.},

	abstract = {Research on the causal relation between extracurricular activities and the development of cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes is scarce at the individual level, despite increasing international evidence that such activities are highly relevant and even, in some cases, more effective than traditional school improvement support programs. Based on an unprecedented intervention in the area of music, this paper evaluates the impact of intensive participation of children and young at-risk students in the creation and development of the first youth orchestra of the municipality of Curanilahue, a small and poor county in the south of Chile, South America. After confronting many potential sources of selection bias in the impact estimation–self-selection, parents selection, orchestra selection, payment capacity–we found positive effects of this experience on participants at both the cognitive and socio-emotional levels. We found that orchestra participation positively affects both language and mathematics in SAT-like tests. The estimated impacts are in the upper bound of the impact evaluation sizes range in the developing world (e.g. Duflo et al., 2013; McEwan, 2012; Ganimian and Murnane, 2016). Furthermore, having analyzed the increase in test scores for those students participating in the orchestra who take the test more than once, we find results that indicate a progressive increase in their scores, both in mathematics and in language, an indicator that can be considered as a proxy of socio-emotional outcomes related to the orientation and persistence to obtain personal goals.},

	abstract = {High prices garnered by British contemporary artists are often presented as a problem of valuation. This article seeks to connect the rapid ascent of British contemporary artists to the emergence and institutionalization of the Turner Prize, today's most prestigious art award. Although prizes and awards proliferate in fields of cultural production, little academic research has investigated their implications for artists’ careers and trajectories. Combining a detailed, qualitative description of the institutionalization of the Turner Prize with a quantitative investigation of its influence on auction prices, we find that British contemporary artists’ unusual valuation pattern (fast market ascension and hastened, rather than “deferred,” commercial success) largely results from a different relation between value and price rooted in the Turner Prize's three innovative valuation mechanisms: brokerage, deliberation, and institutional labeling.},

The volume's chapters expertly explore the conditions in which artistic cooperation takes place, as well as actual practice on the ground, before charting out possible new engagements in transcultural relations." -Yudhishthir Raj Isar, Professor of Cultural Policy Studies, The American University of Paris, France, and the European University Institute, Italy "This timely collection addresses one of the most pressing global issues of our time, how culture is managed, framed and negotiated, and in a variety of domains. The chapters cover an excellent range of topics from a range of disciplinary perspectives and approaches, with many drawing on the first hand experiences of the authors. By foregrounding the undercurrents of 'cultural crossovers', the collection offers fascinating and critical insights into culture today."- Sarita Malik, Professor of Media, Culture and Communications, Brunel University London, UK This book provides new insights into the relationship of the field of arts and cultural management and cultural rights on a global scale. Globalisation and internationalisation have facilitated new forms for exchange between individuals, professions, groups, localities and nations in arts and cultural management. Such exchanges take place through the devising, programming, exhibition, staging, marketing, and administration of project activities. They also take place through teaching and learning within higher education and cultural institutions, which are now internationalised practices themselves. With a focus on the fine, visual and performing arts, the book positions arts and cultural management educators and practitioners as active agents whose decisions, actions and interactions represent how we, as a society, approach, relate to, and understand ourselves and others. This consideration of education and practice as socialisation processes with global, political and social implications will be an invaluable resource to academics, practitioners and students engaging in arts and cultural management, cultural policy, cultural sociology, global and postcolonial studies.},

In the case of the United States, the Latino population represents one the fastest growing-segments of the population, representing at least 16\% (50.5 million). Arts and culture represent one of the main ways in which these communities communicate their identities. For this reason, it is important to understand differences in arts management and cultural agency practices in order to address diversity in the arts and cultural sector. This chapter discusses the theoretical, practical and training aspects that differentiate cultural agency as a complementary approach to arts management. Based on the experiences and practices of cultural agents from Latin America and Puerto Rico, a new model of incorporating cultural policy as a driver of cultural agency is proposed, integrating a cultural mission with local development and sustainable development goals.},

	abstract = {The past thirty years have seen a steady increase in the number of publications in arts management. In addition to the founding of several specialized journals, a major scientific conference was organized in 1991 (International Conference on Arts and Cultural Management). Moreover, close to 400 training programs in cultural management are offered in institutions around the world. All of these signs point to the existence of major research activity and the development of a strong interest for management practices in the arts and cultural sector. Is it possible that, as we stand on the cusp of a new millennium, we are witnessing the birth of a new discipline? Or perhaps a new subdiscipline? How does arts management contribute to the discipline of management itself? This article explores these questions from various angles and proposes several avenues for further research. Depuis trente ans, le nombre de publications sur la gestion des arts ne cesse de croître. Il existe maintenant des revues spécialisées, et l'année 1991 a vu la création d'une conférence scientifique majeure (International Conference on Arts and Cultural Management). De plus, on compte près de 400 programmes de formation en management culturel dans le monde entier. Ce sont là les signes d'une activité de recherche importante et d'un intérêt certain pour les pratiques de gestion dans le domaine des arts et de la culture. Assistons-nous, à l'aube du nouveau millénaire, à la naissance d'une nouvelle discipline? D'une sous-discipline? Quelle contribution la gestion des arts peut-elle apporter à la discipline même du management? Le présent article explore les différents aspects de cette question et propose des pistes de réflexion. Desde hace 30 años, el número de publicadones sobre la gestión de las artes no deja de crecer. Existen ahora revistas especializadas, y en el año 1991 se llevó a cabo una conferendo dentífica de gran importando (International Conference on Arts and Cultural Management). Además, hay cerca de 400 programas de capadtadón en gestión cultural en el mundo entero. Son señales de una actividad importante en lo relativo a la investigadón y de un interés manifiesto por las prácticas de gestión en el campo de las artes y de la cultura. En vísperas del nuevo milenio, ¿estamos presendando el nadmiento de una nueva disdplina? ¿De una subdisdplina? ¿Qué contribudón la gestión de las artes puede aportar a la disdplina de la gestión?

Throughout the 1990s, from the general cultural debate, this discourse has spread to more instrumental considerations and practices in the field of cultural policy. The article presents this process in a historical perspective and characterises the present tendency towards a technocratisation of the discourse of quality under the auspices of New Public Management and the general trend in modern state policy towards instrumentalising all societal resources in the global economic competition. Opposing this line of development, it is argued that "quality" could serve as a progressive, non-instrumentalist discourse if it is defined in relation to a modernised understanding of the "rational core" of the cultural policy tradition of the Nordic countries. In this perspective, the article suggests a contextualisation of the concept of quality and possible ways of implementing the discourse in practical cultural policy.},

In the first part, the authors look at the organisational and conceptual impact on culture of the transition from a centrally managed economy to a pluralist parliamentary democracy following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. The cultural sector experienced privatisation, property restitution, commercialisation, globalisation, decentralisation and devolution, as well as the emergence of the private sector and the non-governmental non-profit sector (NGO). Although the process of societal transformation is now complete, certain key issues of cultural policy remain unresolved. The authors focus on three contemporary issues in theatre, namely: political intervention in the management of public cultural institutions, the persistent debate on funding through grant systems and the lack of trust culture professionals have in the creators of cultural policy. As a result, even though after 1989 it was expected that the private or NGO sector would dominate in the area of culture, there still exists a relatively dense network of public cultural institutions (contributory organisations) characterised by a resistance to proposed organisational and funding changes.},

The fact that the precise nature of both the cultural policy and societal changes that are taking place differ considerably between nation-states implies that arguments concerning the "globalisation" of culture and cultural policy require reformulation to take into account the specific variations that are generated by governmental choices.},

	abstract = {Contemporary society is complex; governed and administered by a range of contradictory policies, practices and techniques. Nowhere are these contradictions more keenly felt than in cultural policy. This book uses insights from a range of disciplines to aid the reader in understanding contemporary cultural policy.  Drawing on a range of case studies, including analysis of the reality of work in the creative industries, urban regeneration and current government cultural policy in the UK, the book discusses the idea of value in the cultural sector, showing how value plays out in cultural organizations. Uniquely, the book crosses disciplinary boundaries to present a thorough introduction to the subject. As a result, the book will be of interest to a range of scholars across arts management, public and nonprofit management, cultural studies, sociology and political science. It will also be essential reading for those working in the arts, culture and public policy.},

	abstract = {Cultural policy intersects with political, economic, and socio-cultural dynamics at all levels of society, placing high and often contradictory expectations on the capabilities and capacities of the media, the fine, performing, and folk arts, and cultural heritage. These expectations are articulated, mobilised and contested at – and across – a global scale. As a result, the study of cultural policy has firmly established itself as a field that cuts across a range of academic disciplines, including sociology, cultural and media studies, economics, anthropology, area studies, languages, geography, and law. This Routledge Handbook of Global Cultural Policy sets out to broaden the field’s consideration to recognise the necessity for international and global perspectives.  The book explores how cultural policy has become a global phenomenon. It brings together a diverse range of researchers whose work reveals how cultural policy expresses and realises common global concerns, dominant narratives, and geopolitical economic and social inequalities. The sections of the book address cultural policy’s relation to core academic disciplines and core questions, of regulations, rights, development, practice, and global issues.  With a cross-section of country-by-country case studies, this comprehensive volume is a map for academics and students seeking to become more globally orientated cultural policy scholars.},

We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a €2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (€180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners’ improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often.},

He examines the individuals and institutions involved in making cultural products what they are: not only the writers and artists, but also the publishers, critics, dealers, galleries, and academies. He analyzes the structure of the cultural field itself as well as its position within the broader social structures of power.The essays in his volume examine such diverse topics as Flaubert's point of view, Manet's aesthetic revolution, the historical creation of the pure gaze, and the relationship between art and power.The Field of Cultural Porduction will be of interest to students and scholars from a wide range of disciplines: sociology and social theory, literature, art, and cultural studies.},

The agent chooses the properties of the signals that he receives, so as to minimize the mean squared difference between his action and the optimal action, subject to a constraint on information flow. We prove that the optimal signal is a one-dimensional signal about the elements of the state vector, which typically has non-zero signal weights on all elements of the state vector. The intuition for these results is that an agent with memory and limited attention wants to learn about the current optimal action and the best predictors of future optimal actions. Hence, in a dynamic economy, rational inattention creates a combination of delay in actions due to noise in the optimal signal and forward-looking actions due to forward-looking information choice. We illustrate these analytical results in a macroeconomic model of price-setting and a business cycle model with news shocks.},

Both preferences and consideration sets are stochastic. While we present axiomatisations for this model, our focus is on the following identification question: to what extent can an observer retrieve probabilities of preferences and consideration sets from observed choices? Our first conclusion is a negative one: if the observed data are choice probabilities, then probabilities of preferences and consideration sets cannot be retrieved from choice probabilities. We solve the identification problem by assuming that an “enriched” dataset is observed, which includes choice probabilities under two frames. Given this dataset, the model is “fully identified”, in the sense that we can recover from observed choices (i) the probabilities of preferences (to the same extent as in models with full attention) and (ii) the probabilities of consideration sets. While a number of recent papers have developed models of limited attention that are, in a similar sense, “fully identified”, they obtain this result not by using an enriched dataset but rather by making a restrictive assumption about the default option, which our paper avoids.},

            Chileans have limited knowledge of the pension system, its rules, and the consequences involved in their personal decisions within it. Using a variation in the household composition – having a pensioner in the household – as an instrument, we show that Chileans with greater knowledge about the pension system are more likely to have additional financial savings, but not within the voluntary pension saving plans offered by the pension system. We find that getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) generates approximately a 50\% additional chance that the individual will save at least in one of the surveyed periods, and a 25\% additional chance that the individual will save in both surveyed periods. We also test for evidence that pension literacy affects worker choices regarding their pension savings (what we call active financial behavior). We find that more literate workers are more likely to engage in pension fund type switching and that independent workers are more likely to voluntarily enter the pension system as affiliates if they have greater pension finance literacy. Getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) increases the probability of pension fund type switching by 20\% and the probability of voluntary affiliation to the pension system of self-employed workers by 30\%.},

We study optimal plan implementation in a theoretical model and analyze how the right menu of portfolio options and default option should be chosen based on the financial sophistication of the participants, their behavioral biases, the prevalent political philosophy, and the political economy. The paper provides several novel positive and normative implications, which appear to be empirically plausible.},

	abstract = {Financial literacy and schooling attainment have been linked to household wealth accumulation. Yet prior findings may be biased due to noisy measures of financial literacy and schooling, as well as unobserved factors such as ability, intelligence, and motivation that could enhance financial literacy and schooling but also directly affect wealth accumulation. Here we use a new household dataset and an instrumental variables approach to isolate the causal effects of financial literacy and schooling on wealth accumulation. While financial literacy and schooling attainment are both strongly positively associated with wealth outcomes in linear regression models, our approach reveals even stronger and larger effects of financial literacy on wealth. It also indicates no significant positive effects of schooling attainment conditional on financial literacy in a linear specification, but positive effects when interacted with financial literacy. Estimated impacts are substantial enough to suggest that investments in financial literacy could have large positive payoffs.},

The model is calibrated to China’s economy. The results show that both the carbon tax and carbon intensity target policies have a negative effect on China’s economy and environment. However, the carbon tax exerts more negative effects on the economy and environment than the carbon intensity target. Moreover, the carbon tax shock lasts shorter than the carbon intensity target shock. The findings additionally indicate that the effects of the increase in the productivity of energy sectors are greater than those of the increase in the productivity of other sectors. Thanks to the low-carbon technology shock, China’s carbon dioxide emissions will reduce and output will increase. Taken together, this study highlights the key policy implications associated with the results.},

            We study contestability in charity markets where non-commercial, not-for-profit providers supply a homogeneous collective good through increasing-returns-to-scale technologies. Unlike in the case of for-profit competition, the absence of price-based sales contracts for charities means that fixed costs can translate into entry barriers, protecting the position of an inefficient incumbent; or, conversely, they can make it possible for inefficient newcomers to contest the position of a more efficient incumbent. Evidence from laboratory experiments show that fixed-cost driven tradeoffs between efficiency and perceived risk can lead to inefficient technology adoption.},

	abstract = {A review of the literature on organizational rankings across management, sociology, education, and law reveals three perspectives on these complex evaluations—rankings are seen as a form of information intermediation, as comparative orderings, or as a means for surveillance and control. The information intermediation perspective views rankings as information products that address information asymmetries between the ranked organizations and their stakeholders; the comparative orderings perspective views them as representations of organizational status and reputation; and the surveillance and control perspective emphasizes their disciplining power that subjects ranked organizations to political and economic interests. For each perspective, we identify core contributions as well as additional questions that extend the current body of research. We also identify a new perspective—rankings entrepreneurship—which has been overlooked to date but presents significant opportunities to extend our understanding of the production and consumption of rankings.},

The argument that corporate managers should replace their singular focus on shareholders with a broader vision, where they also serve other stakeholders, including customers, employees and society, has found a receptive audience with corporate CEOs and institutional investors. The pitch that companies should focus on “doing good” is sweetened with the promise that it will also be good for their bottom line and for shareholders. In this paper, we build a framework for value that will allow us to examine how being socially responsible can manifest in the tangible ingredients of value and look at the evidence for whether being socially responsible is creating value for companies and for investors.},

Second, it documents the main features of business cycles in Chile. The volatility and persistence of several variables across the cycles is described, together with the correlations within a set of significant variables. In general, the correlations observed tend to indicate that supply-side factors play an important role in explaining business cycles in Chile. On the aggregate demand side, terms of trade and availability of foreign capital are found to have substantial effects on all its different components.},

Our results indicate that the contribution of TFP to growth differs significantly from one period to another. During 1961-1973 the contribution of capital dominates, labor takes over in 1974-1989, and TFP in 1990-2003. Evidence on TFP determinants suggests that, besides cyclical factors, TFP growth reflects the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The interaction of both factors in TFP behavior is worth noting. Evidence suggests also that, under conditions of high macroeconomic instability, the effects of a structural reform on TFP are smaller, and vice versa. An analogous situation can be expected from macroeconomic stabilization efforts.},

The contribution of the productivity to the sectorial growth is estimated residually, based on a Cobb-Douglas production function for the sectorial GDP and independent measures for capital and labor, corrected by quality and intensity of use. As a result, the sectorial TFP has exhibited a downward trend in the last five years, after remaining virtually flat since 1986 to 2011. The economic growth of the sector shows to be dominated by the accumulation of factors rather than by the efficiency with which they are used in the productive process. This could explain, partially, the vulnerability of sectorial activity to the economic cycle.},

The relaxed lending standards led to significant outflows of whites from black and racially mixed neighborhoods. Without such a credit supply shock, black households would have had between 2.3 and 5.1 percentage points more white neighbors in 2010.},

The theory of rational inattention assumes that agents cannot process all available information, but they can choose which exact pieces of information to attend to. Several important results in economics have been built around imperfect information. Nowadays, many more forms of information than ever before are available due to new technologies, and yet we are able to digest little of it. Which form of imperfect information we possess and act upon is thus largely determined by which information we choose to attend to. These choices are driven by current economic conditions and imply behavior that features numerous empirically supported departures from standard models. Combining these insights about human limitations with the optimizing approach of neoclassical economics yields a new, generally applicable model.},

This draws on limited resources of attention and requires economizing on attention devoted to signals related to economic behaviour. A natural measure of such costs is based on Shannon’s “channel capacity”. Modelling economic agents as constrained by Shannon capacity as they process freely available information turns out to imply that discretely distributed actions, and thus actions that persist across repetitions of the same decision problem, are very likely to emerge in settings that without information costs would imply continuously distributed behaviour. We show how these results apply to the behaviour of an investor choosing portfolio allocations, as well as to some mathematically simpler “tracking” problems that illustrate the mechanism. Trying to use costs of adjustment to explain “stickiness” of actions when interpreting the behaviour in our economic examples would lead to mistaken conclusions.},

            Consideration set models generalize discrete-choice models by relaxing the assumption that consumers consider all available options. Determining which options were considered has previously required either survey data or restrictions on how attributes impact consideration or utility. We provide an alternative route. In full-consideration models, choice probabilities satisfy a symmetry property analogous to Slutsky symmetry in continuous-choice models. This symmetry breaks down in consideration set models when changes in characteristics perturb consideration. We show that consideration probabilities are constructively identified from the resulting asymmetries. We validate our approach in a lab experiment where consideration sets are known and then apply our framework to study a “smart default” policy in Medicare Part D, wherein consumers are automatically reassigned to lower-cost prescription drug plans with the option of opting out. Full-consideration models imply such a policy will be ineffective because consumers will opt out to avoid switching costs. Allowing for inattention, we find that defaulting all consumers to lower-cost options produces negligible welfare benefits on average, but defaulting only consumers who would save at least \$300 produces large benefits.},

One candidate explanation is that funds process information about future asset values and use that information to invest in high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This paper tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model that uses the state of the business cycle to predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable patterns of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the data. These findings offer new evidence that some investment managers have skill and that attention is allocated rationally.},

If the agent’s problem is to choose the consumption levels of many goods with different degrees of substitutability, then she may create mental budgets for more substitutable products (e.g., entertainment). In some situations, it is optimal to specify budgets in terms of consumption quantities, but when most products have an abundance of substitutes, specifying budgets in terms of nominal spending tends to be optimal. If the goods are complements, in contrast, then the agent may—consistent with naive diversification—choose a fixed, unconsidered mix of products. And if the agent’s problem is to choose one of multiple products to fulfill a given consumption need (e.g., for gasoline or a bed), then it is often optimal for her to allocate a fixed sum for the need.},

	abstract = {The concept of sustainable and responsible (SR) investments expresses that every investment should be based on the SR investor’s code of ethics. To a large extent the allocation of SR investments to more sustainable companies and ethical practices is based on the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) scores provided by rating agencies. However, a thorough investigation of ESG scores is a neglected topic in the literature. This paper uses Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG ratings to analyze the influence of firm size, a company’s available resources for providing ESG data, and the availability of a company’s ESG data on the company’s sustainability performance. We find a significant positive correlation between the stated variables, which can be explained by organizational legitimacy. The results raise the question of whether the way the ESG score measures corporate sustainability gives an advantage to larger firms with more resources while not providing SR investors with the information needed to make decisions based on their beliefs. Due to our results, SR investors and scholars should reopen the discussion about: what sustainability rating agencies measure with ESG scores, what exactly needs to be measured, and if the sustainable finance community can reach their self-imposed objectives with this measurement.},

We argue that the difference in returns between ethical and conventional indices may, in fact, be insignificant due to the ‘mainstreaming’ of ethical investment. Using a database of 24 international indices over the 2008–2014 time periods, we calculate rolling daily returns, develop a robust test for difference in Sharpe ratios, and compare alfas across EGARCH asset pricing models with endogenous volatility breakpoints. Results converge to indicate no significant difference in financial performance between conventional and ethical indices. This validates the ‘mainstreaming’ hypothesis and opens avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {We provide a detailed holdings-based analysis of investment decisions made by U.S. equity SRI funds. Besides incorporating conventional fundamental factors, such as earnings growth, leverage, dividend yield, stock return and volatility, SRI funds adjust portfolio weights by considering companies’ relative ESG performance. This holds for all categories of passively and actively managed funds, while for active funds ESG scores have a higher economic impact for value rather than growth funds. The timing of inclusion of companies in active SRI funds or their exclusion is driven primarily by fundamentals rather than by ESG performance. We find that both active SRI and matched conventional funds integrate ESG information as well as financial criteria in their investment decisions, but SRI portfolios exhibit higher average sustainability scores. Finally, we posit that SRI screening criteria effectively guide investment decisions, positive screening resulting in higher active portfolio weights of best performers in a corresponding ESG pillar.},

	abstract = {Fair division, a key concern in the design of many social institutions, has for 70 years been the subject of interdisciplinary research at the interface of mathematics, economics, and game theory. Motivated by the proliferation of moneyless transactions on the internet, the computer science community has recently taken a deep interest in fairness principles and practical division rules. The resulting literature brings a fresh concern for computational simplicity (scalable rules) and realistic implementation. In this review of the most salient fair division results of the past 30 years, I concentrate on division rules with the best potential for practical implementation. The critical design parameter is the message space that the agents must use to report their individual preferences. A simple preference domain is key both to realistic implementation and to the existence of division rules with strong normative and incentive properties. I discuss successively the one-dimensional single-peaked domain, Leontief utilities, ordinal ranking, dichotomous preferences, and additive utilities. Some of the theoretical results in the latter domain are already implemented in the user-friendly SPLIDDIT platform (http://spliddit.org).},

Marcel Jeucken sets out to rectify this state of affairs, in a style which is accessible to those with no experience of environmental finance issues. He provides a comprehensive account of their interdependence: why the financial sector is crucial to achieving sustainability and why the triple bottom line of commercial, environmental and social success points the way forward for banking. From a systematic assessment of major banks around the world, he presents a comprehensive account of current best practice, an analysis of the differences in approach and performance, and recommendations of actions and policies for improved performance that will contribute to sustainable development.},

It appears that most of the literature concentrates on the role of public shareholders when it comes to changing corporate policy and performance in a more sustainable direction. However, this focus neglects the potential impact of the credit channel and private equity on a firm’s non-financial policies and performance. These very powerful mechanisms can govern business policies and practices. Therefore, there appears to be much more scope for finance to promote socially and environmentally desirable activities and to discourage detrimental activities than has been acknowledged in the academic literature so far.},

	abstract = {The idea that underlying, generative mechanisms give rise to causal regularities has become a guiding principle across many social and natural science disciplines. A specific form of this enquiry, realist evaluation is gaining momentum in the evaluation of complex social interventions. It focuses on ‘what works, how, in which conditions and for whom’ using context, mechanism and outcome configurations as opposed to asking whether an intervention ‘works’. Realist evaluation can be difficult to codify and requires considerable researcher reflection and creativity. As such there is often confusion when operationalising the method in practice. This article aims to clarify and further develop the concept of mechanism in realist evaluation and in doing so aid the learning of those operationalising the methodology.},

Recently, scholars have called for increased multilevel developmental analyses of the bio-psychosocial nature of risk and protection for behaviors of individuals. This paper draws on several different but converging theoretical perspectives in an attempt to provide an overview of research relevant to stress in adolescence and puts forth a new framework that aims to provide both a common language and consilience by which future research can analyze the effects of multiple biological, social and environmental factors experienced during specific developmental periods, and cumulatively over time, on harmful behavior during adolescence. We present a framework to examine the effects of stress on diverse behavioral outcomes among adolescents, including substance use, suicidal behavior, self-inflicted harm, and delinquency.},

	abstract = {This paper examined the recreational trail preferences of visitors in the Medvednica Nature Park, a protected forest area on the outskirts of the City of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted to get the insight into relative importance of different resource, social and managerial conditions in the park. Accounting for multiple site conditions requires a relatively large number of choice attributes, which may impose too high cognitive burden on respondents. On the other hand, ignoring relevant attributes may lead to the omitted variable bias. A split sample approach was used to find the balance between the possibility of omitted variable bias and cognitive burden; one version of the questionnaire used DCE with the lower number of attributes, of which some were multidimensional, while the other version used DCE with the greater number of more specific attributes. By using partial profile design in the latter experiment, the number of attributes in the choice task was identical in both experiments. Perceived difficulty of the choice task, self-reported choice certainty and choice consistency were similar across the two experiments. Heterogeneity in preferences and scale was detected in both experiments. Indications of non-compensatory behavior, and greater error variance among less experienced trail users were found in the partial profile experiment with more specific trail attributes, but not in the experiment with multidimensional attributes. Based on the research results, important managerial implications were derived. Non-visual sensory experiences of nature, namely fresh air and soundscape, were generally more important to trail users than visual experiences. Crowding was detected as an important characteristic of trail experience; however, trail users were willing to tolerate relatively high levels of crowding.},

Around the world, specialized intermediaries have appeared, mainstream financial players and governments have become involved, renowned universities have included impact investing courses in their curriculum, and a myriad of practitioner contributions have been published. Despite all this activity, conceptual clarity remains an issue: The absence of a uniform definition, the interchangeable use of alternative terms and unclear boundaries to related concepts such as socially responsible investment are being criticized. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of impact investing, which could help foster this specific investment style and guide further academic research. To do so, it investigates a large number of academic and practitioner works, highlighting areas of similarity and inconsistency on three levels: definitional, terminological, and strategic. Our research shows that, on a general level, heterogeneity—especially definitional and strategic—is less pronounced than expected. Yet, our research also reveals critical issues that need to be clarified to advance the field and increase its credibility. First and foremost, this includes the characteristics required of impact investees, notably whether they need to be (social sector) organizations that prioritize their non-financial mission over the business side. Our results indicate that there may be different schools of thoughts concerning this matter.},

	abstract = {Microfinance institutions provide loans to low-income individuals. Their credit scoring systems, if they exist, are strictly financial. Although many institutions consider the social and environmental impact of their loans, they do not incorporate formal systems to estimate these social and environmental impacts. This paper proposes that their creditworthiness evaluations should be coherent with their social mission and, accordingly, should estimate the social and environmental impact of microcredit. Thus, a decision support system to facilitate microcredit granting is proposed using a multicriteria evaluation. The assessment of social impact is performed by calculating the Social Net Present Value. The system captures credit officers' experience and addresses incomplete and intangible information. The model has been tested in a microfinance institution. The paper shows how a small institution can include social and environmental issues in its decision-making systems to evaluate credit applications. A gap in the preferences was found between members of the board, who are socially driven, and managers and credit officers, who are financially drifted. This mission drift was corrected. The approach followed contributed to creating a culture of social and environmental assessment within the institution, especially among credit officers, thereby translating Microfinance institutions' social mission into numbers.},

This paper addresses this gap: (1) by conceptualizing social finance (SF) as a pre-paradigmatic field where leading SF institutions have spontaneously adopted different investment rationalities and logics to achieve positive social impact through financing and banking activities; (2) by discussing dominant institutionalization patterns, empirically exploring the institutionalization of SF at the organizational, inter-organizational and institutional levels. A sample of seventeen SF institutions in three European countries, i.e. Ireland, Italy and the UK, was examined. The analysis highlighted that two forms of SF, i.e. social impact investment and ethical banking, guide the institutionalization and paradigm-building process. These two forms both assume the production of social impact, i.e. impact on society, the environment and sustainable development, as a distinguishing trait from commercial financial approaches, but differ in terms of business models and products and services provided to customers. Dominant institutionalization patterns reflect the social-embeddedness of these institutions. The convergence of the two dominant models would be desirable in order to further facilitate the development of social finance as a new paradigm in the financing and banking industry, alternative to commercial finance.},

The commons are defined as resources that are shared and collectively managed by communities of users, such as natural commons (e.g. fisheries, the climate) and knowledge commons (e.g. Wikipedia, open-source software). The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents the findings of the PhD dissertation “Social finance and the commons,” recipient of the 2017 Emerald/EFMD Outstanding Doctoral Research Award, category Management and Governance, sponsored by Management Decision. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective of the commons, this dissertation investigates how community enterprises govern financial resources as commons to serve the common good. To do so, it builds on data collected on community development banks in Brazil and complementary currencies in multiple countries. Findings The findings explain how collective action favors the implementation of new forms of governance and management potentially enabling finance to create and support communities. In doing so, this dissertation provides insights on the transformative power of some governance features for the creation of commons. Originality/value This dissertation advances theoretical and conceptual foundations for a theory of the commons in management sciences. It contributes to a new conceptualization of the commons, especially by extending the concept of commons to finance and showing the variety of commons according to governance structures and values. It also generates theoretical insights into social and community entrepreneurship research through an in-depth investigation of social finance organizations.},

This article’s critical analysis of social finance contributes to cultural economy research into marketization processes in economic geography and allied fields. First, responding to calls for greater attention to be given to heterogeneous and variegated market-making processes ‘on the ground’, social finance is analysed as a relatively discrete and hybrid modality of marketization that makes possible the valuation and capitalization of the social economy to address collective social problems. Second, moving beyond topographical accounts that understand geographies of marketization as ‘taking place’ through the outward expansion of the market’s imagined boundaries, Gilles Deleuze’s concept of ‘the fold’ is elaborated upon to develop a topological analysis of the spatial constitution of social finance markets. The folds of social finance are seams of inflection, entanglements where the social utility typically lacking from mainstream finance is variously spliced and stitched into marketization processes. In social finance markets-in-the-making, ‘the social’ is also shown to be remade as an array of thoroughly liberal associations and subjectivities that are, at once, pluralist, ethical and entrepreneurial.},

	abstract = {Developing countries experience poor and deteriorating water services where the costs of improvements, water utilities assume, are not affordable by households. However, if water services are hypothetically improved, are households willing to pay? From employment of an attribute-based stated-preference method, the paper examines households' willingness to pay for improvements in water services in a city in south India. Aside of quantity, households are willing to pay for improvements in quality, pressure, frequency of supply, and increased quanta of supply during the dry season. In addition, households prefer regulation in water services, albeit from a public service provider. In Asian countries and other developing country regions households' willingness to pay is substantially higher than the costs of the provision of water, and on a par with mean water tariffs in developed regions of the world.},

In the model, producer and consumer choices that adjust quickly to stimuli reach temporary equilibria subject to recursively updated activity churn, background trends, estate development, and transport supply. The city region's performance at each time horizon affects the recursive variables for the next. The model builds on field leaders of urban general equilibrium, spatial interaction, and nonequilibrium dynamic models, and offers theoretical and practical improvements in order to fill an important gap in long-range urban forecasting. Linking the equilibrium and nonequilibrium models enables the simulation of path dependence in urban evolution trajectories that neither could produce in isolation. At the same time the model provides quantification of impacts of different policy interventions on a consistent basis for a given time horizon. The model is tested on the main archetypal urban development strategies for large-scale development and restructuring.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: It is commonly asserted that so-called compact development is the urban form most able to sustainably accommodate growth by reducing travel distances and conserving land, but credible supportive evidence remains limited. This study rigorously and realistically tested the relative performance of spatial options over the next 30 years for three distinct kinds of English city regions. Statistical models first forecast the behavior of people within interacting markets for land and transport. These outputs were then fed to established simulation models to generate 26 indicators measuring the economic efficiency, resource use, social impact, and environmental impact of the spatial options. This permitted an explicit comparison of the costs and benefits of compact against sprawling urban forms for these regions. While the prototypes (i.e., compaction, sprawl, edge expansion, and new towns) were indeed found to differ in their sustainability, no one form was clearly superior. Rather, the change to “white collar” lifestyles and associated population growth dominates the impacts on the natural environment and resources, far overwhelming those attributable to spatial urban form. Takeaway for practice: Urban form policies can have important impacts on local environmental quality, economy, crowding, and social equity, but their influence on energy consumption and land use is very modest; compact development should not automatically be associated with the preferred spatial growth strategy. Research support: The research was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council.},

Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics.

As the result of an empirical analysis over the period 1992–2008, we base our segmentation on investment screens that help us to examine whether values affect prices. We find that, although the profit-driven segment earns abnormal returns in the short run, these profit-generating opportunities do not persist in the long run for SRI stocks.

The first goal of our paper is to identify a small number of independent and relevant socially responsible (SR) dimensions reflecting a firms’ coherent posture toward social issues. We put forward that these dimensions are not exactly the same as the ESG ones (Environment, Social, and Governance). Using the six sub-ratings provided by the Vigeo rating agency, we perform a principal component analysis and we highlight three main independent SR dimensions related to (1) business stakeholders (employees, customers, and suppliers), (2) societal stakeholders (environment and society), and (3) financial stakeholders (stockholders and debt holders). The second objective of our paper is to explore the link between stock returns and these three SR dimensions. Our most notable finding is that for each SR dimension, investors ask for an additional risk premium when they accept to hold non-socially responsible stocks. The cost of equity is thus lower for SR firms. The average premium over the period 2003–2010 is larger for the components “business stakeholders” and “financial stakeholders” than for the component “societal stakeholders.” The premium for this last component has only existed since the end of 2008. Since that time, environment and community involvement have become important risk factors strongly considered by investors. For the three dimensions, investors notably penalize large non-social firms and reward small social firms.},

We demonstrate that an unpleasant consequence of SRI is that since investors refuse to hold all assets because of ethical considerations, “unethical” firms must be priced lower than other firms, to compensate conventional investors for not being able to hold the market portfolio.},

The tensions between continuing short-term economic growth whilst investing in low-carbon technologies for long-term decarbonisation could be eased if there were significant financial and non-climate potential benefits of decarbonisation for these economies. This study explores some of the potential benefits for India, by analysing its long-term mitigation options in the context of global action towards a 2 °C target, using an energy systems model (The University College London TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, or TIAM–UCL) which represents India explicitly, as one of 16 global regions. The study finds that India could significantly over-achieve against a 2050 low-carbon target based on equal per capita emissions by 2050, at mitigation costs below the global carbon price, implying that it could earn significant revenues through selling international carbon credits, thereby offsetting some of the costs of decarbonisation. In addition, India would see much lower levels of fossil fuel consumption in a low-carbon scenario, thereby alleviating potential economic difficulties in securing access to adequate supplies of these fuels.},

In this analysis we discussed the impacts of a linked ETS in achieving the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) emission reduction target in 2030 with a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We find that Global ETS can distinctly reduce the emission reduction cost in Annex I countries. The equilibrium CO2 price in the global carbon market in 2030 is around \$29.83 per ton of CO2, lower than that of the United States (\$45.19/tCO2) and the EU (\$41.50/tCO2), about the same level with that of China (\$37.30/tCO2), and higher than that of India (\$8.39/tCO2) and Russia (\$3.97/tCO2) in National ETS Scenario. As the reallocation of emission permits in linking ETS would alter the energy consumption cost of the participant countries, the permit importers' production would be more cost competitive, especially for energy intensive products. The permit exporters undertake the opposite economic impact. However, the fund transferred from the permit importers could stimulate consumption and investment activities in permit exporter countries and overall the linking ETS increase the economic aggregate of the participating countries.},

	abstract = {In Copenhagen climate conference China government promised that China would cut down carbon intensity 40–45\% from 2005 by 2020. CET (carbon emissions trading) is an effective tool to reduce emissions. But because CET is not fully implemented in China up to now, how to design it and its potential impact are unknown to us. This paper studies the potential impact of introduction of CET on China’s power sector and discusses the impact of different allocation options of allowances. Agent-based modeling is one appealing new methodology that has the potential to overcome some shortcomings of traditional methods. We establish an agent-based model, CETICEM (CET Introduced China Electricity Market), of introduction of CET to China. In CETICEM, six types of agents and two markets are modeled. We find that: (1) CET internalizes environment cost; increases the average electricity price by 12\%; and transfers carbon price volatility to the electricity market, increasing electricity price volatility by 4\%. (2) CET influences the relative cost of different power generation technologies through the carbon price, significantly increasing the proportion of environmentally friendly technologies; expensive solar power generation in particular develops significantly, with final proportion increasing by 14\%. (3) Emission-based allocation brings about both higher electricity and carbon prices than by output-based allocation which encourages producers to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, output-based allocation would be more conducive to reducing emissions in the Chinese power sector.},

Moreover, power production frequently entails a number of negative externalities, like greenhouse gas emissions from thermo electrical units. This situation has highlighted the need for countries to move towards sustainable economic growth. Accordingly, many countries have proposed and established measures to decrease their carbon emissions. In this line, the Chilean government has just passed a carbon tax of \$5/Ton CO2e. In this work, we compare the effects on reducing CO2 emissions of this carbon tax and of some energy efficiency measures in the power sector. The results obtained indicate that the imposed carbon tax will produce an expected annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 1\% with respect to the estimated baseline during the 2014–2024 period. However, this reduction will be accompanied by an expected 3.4\% increase in the marginal cost of power production on the main Chilean power system. In contrast, the introduction of some energy efficiency measures, aimed to reduce 2\% of the power demand of the residential sector, could achieve larger reductions in CO2 emissions, while simultaneously decreasing energy price.},

In this context, the effectiveness of the tax application is analyzed with an optimization model, for which it is assumed that industrial plants have the option of replacing fuels in their production processes and that thermoelectric power plants could invest in carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) in order to reduce its CO2 emissions and tax burden. Additionally, the option of early shutdown of coal-fired thermoelectric power plants and their replacement by solar plants with the same electricity generation capacity is evaluated. The results of the simulations show that the current tax rate of 5 US\$/tCO2 would reduce total emissions by 3.6\%. This reduction is generated by the substitution of fuels, and also, it is explained because an old thermoelectric power plant decides to shut down early and install solar plants instead. On the other hand, thermoelectric power plants would only reduce their emissions with CCS technology if taxes of approximately 40 US\$/tCO2 are set. Thus, it can be concluded that the tax applied in Chile must be substantially increased to be an effective measure for emissions reduction.},

Against this context, we reveal limitations and counter-intuitive results in the model-based optimization of energy systems, which are often applied for policy advice. When system costs are minimized in the presence of a CO2 cap, efficiency gains free a part of the CO2 cap, allowing cheap technologies to replace expensive low-emission technologies. Even more striking results are observed in a setup where emissions are minimized in the presence of a budget constraint. Increasing CO2 prices can oust clean, but expensive technologies out of the system, and eventually lead to higher emissions. These effects robustly occur in models of different scope and complexity. Hence, extreme care is necessary in the application of energy system optimization models to avoid misleading policy advice.},

To answer the question, we perform a regression analysis of California’s electricity market data for a 65-month period of 01/01/2011–05/31/2016. Based on this newly constructed large sample, we find that the California Independent System Operator’s real-time market prices contain a CO2 premium that closely tracks the marginal cost of CO2 emissions of California’s natural-gas-fired generation units, which are often at margin that determines the power prices. While the CO2 premium provides much needed incentives for renewable energy development, it does little to improve the incentive for natural-gas-fired generation investment in California. Hence, procurement of dispatchable generation capacity via long-term contracts continues to be useful for the state to meet the mandatory criteria for resource adequacy and system reliability.},

Many methods have been used to evaluate the effect and efficiency of the ETS in reducing carbon emissions. Evaluating the carbon ETS to determine whether it has co-benefited the economy and environment in the seven pilots is crucial for the development of China. Moreover, different methods of measurement reveal different results on how efficient the seven carbon emission trading markets (ETMs) are. We use the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of carbon emissions and economic growth following ETS implementation. Based on the data of industrial carbon emissions in 30 provinces of China from 2008 to 2016, the impact of ETS on the carbon emission reduction and economic growth of enterprises is empirically tested. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluates the operating efficiency of the carbon ETMs. Based on the seven carbon emission trading pilots conducted in China in 2014–2016, the carbon ETMs differentiation system in the pilot area is taken as the input index and the ETS implementation effect is used as the output index to construct the full DEA evaluation model for gauging the operation efficiency of the carbon ETMs. The results show that the implementation of the carbon trading policy increases the economic dividend (13.6\%) generated by the gross industrial output value, but significantly reduces the emission (24.2\%) of industrial CO2 in all seven carbon emission trading pilots. The average DEA efficiency of the seven carbon ETMs operations in China have increased annually.},

The results show that the emission-based ETS quota decline scheme will motivate the society to pay more attention to emission reduction. However, the scheme based on CI will make the society to focus more on resources allocation, which means that it will result to more emission and less Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but higher social welfare compared to the emission-based scenarios. The higher annual decline factor will increase the industry's pressure to cut emissions. This will cause less social welfare, GDP, sectorial output and fluctuation in commodity price. Moreover, we find that as the government fines are higher than ETS price, industries are reluctant to raise prices when they trade for cost minimization, especially those industries that incur government fine.},

One important finding from this study is that the global emissions in trade primarily have flown from developing to developed countries and regions. Notably, however, for those countries endowed with rich natural resources and developed economy like Canada, they have become the net carbon exporters in trade. Another important finding is that such important determinants as energy and industrial structure have spatial spillover effects on the emissions embodied in trade changes. Regarding climate policies, our results suggest that the increase in the share of clean energy could curtail the impact of trade on global carbon emissions. Notably, our study also finds that improving energy efficiency would not lower the emissions embodied in global trade because the forecasted reduction in energy use and thus carbon emissions that may be lost due to the sum of consumer and market responses.},

To meet this challenge, a distributed dual consensus algorithm based the alternating direction method of multipliers is implemented by sharing Lagrangian multipliers associated with coupling constraints between partitioned subproblems rather than phase angles on adjacent buses that are usually shared, thus protecting the key private information of each subsystem. Furthermore, a fully decentralized algorithm is proposed by adopting the finite-time average consensus algorithm, which enables each partition to iteratively approach a consensus of its shared information in a finite number of steps. For comparison purposes, a global-based centralized optimization is implemented at first, adopting the effect of carbon price on the operation of a modified IEEE-30 bus system, followed by tests of the proposed algorithms with three different partitioning methods of power systems. Results illustrate that a higher carbon price can be regarded as an incentive to decrease the wind curtailment rates and spur the increased use of clean fuel. Compared with the results of the centralized optimization, both the algorithms can achieve satisfactory convergence accuracies, although the fully decentralized algorithm requires slightly longer time for computation.},

Moreover, several traditional allocation methods for initial carbon emission rights emphasizing the equality are introduced, and the uncertainty characterizations of wind power are discussed through the scenario-generation technique. The simulation results eventually demonstrate that the operating cost for non-cooperative mode cannot be optimized as the ratio of carbon emission reductions rises; carbon trading mechanism is beneficial for lower cost under the pressure of carbon emission reduction; carbon price ranges that suit both carbon trading parties could be deduced. Synthesizing wind power uncertainty and carbon emission rights, this study is helpful for allocating the load demand of wind power integrated system to each generating unit more scientifically and reasonably based on carbon trading mechanism.},

Results indicate that scenarios with significant energy demand reduction for all sectors showed considerable emission reduction by 2030. In all scenarios, demand sector showed major contribution to emissions when compared to transformation sector. Although emissions from transformation sector demonstrate significant reduction by 2030, decrease in demand side is not clearly noticed for some scenarios. Chile requires appropriate energy efficiency and renewable energy policies for demand sides of sectors especially transport, mining and other industries to reduce emissions at demand-side as having decarbonization for transformation side. Scenarios including more wind, PVsolar, CSPsolar and hydropower plants reached more than 80\% renewable electricity generation by 2030. Thus, cleaner production portfolio which results in fewer emissions and more diversification in terms of energy generation can be established in Chile.},

	abstract = {Public policies that lead to a reduction in the emissions of air and water pollutants or the protection of sensitive ecosystems presumably increase the well-being of many members of society. Applied welfare economists are accustomed to measuring the welfare effects of policies that invoke price changes. If it is granted that the public good attributes of most dimensions of environmental quality preclude the development of well functioning markets for these service flows, how are the monetary values of changes in environmental quality to be measured? The past twenty to thirty years have seen the rapid development of the economic theory and techniques for measuring the demands for nonmarketed goods, and in this chapter we attempt to sketch out the major results. We review the basic concept of economic welfare and derive measures of welfare change for both changes in prices of market goods and changes in quantities and qualities of nonmarket goods. We then describe the principal economic techniques for estimating the benefits of environmental quality improvements when these improvements either directly affect individuals' well-being or indirectly affect individuals through constraints they face. Perhaps the major class of measurement methods is based on the observation that changes in environmental quality may cause individuals to alter purchases of goods and services that are complements or substitutes for environmental quality in their preference orderings. These revealed preference methods are the primary focus of this chapter. A second major approach to obtaining estimates of the benefits and costs of environmental changes, stated preference methods, are addressed in detail in later chapters. Our treatment of welfare effects places special emphasis on the connection between the underlying economic theory and practical empirical models.},

Our findings suggest that good local public services have a positive impact on individuals’ trust, the effect being stronger for trust in local institutions. Our results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, tested using a two-step GMM estimation procedure, and to potential omitted variables bias, according to the method proposed by Altonji et al.

In recent years research has proceeded on a track to incorporate stochasticity in one way or another. However, the main focus has been on rather limited ideas of what a stochastic variational inequality might be. Because variational inequalities are especially tuned to capturing conditions for optimality and equilibrium, stochastic variational inequalities ought to provide such service for problems of optimization and equilibrium in a stochastic setting. Therefore they ought to be able to deal with multistage decision processes involving actions that respond to increasing levels of information. Critical for that, as discovered in stochastic programming, is introducing nonanticipativity as an explicit constraint on responses along with an associated “multiplier” element which captures the “price of information” and provides a means of decomposition as a tool in algorithmic developments. That idea is extended here to a framework which supports multistage optimization and equilibrium models while also clarifying the single-stage picture.},

Countries that excel at developing semiconductors should develop mobile phones because both technologies require similar endogenous capacities, including scientific knowledge. However, thus far, studies have been mostly limited to the knowledge common base assumption and have not questioned enough whether different scientific endogenous capacities may be behind similar diversification performances. To address this question, we introduce the concept of scientific and technological cross-density, which we define as the average proximity of a new potential technology to a country's scientific and technological portfolio. To conceptualize and measure the effect that scientific and technological cross-density may have on technological diversification, we applied a two-stage methodology to a sample of 182 countries during the 1988–2014 period. First, we build a network, the science and technology cross-space, (sci-tech cross-space), which relates knowledge and technologies based on co-occurrence values. Second, we estimate the effect of scientific-technological cross-density and technological density on technological diversification at the country level. We find that the more a new technology is related to a country's scientific portfolio, the greater its entry probability; additionally, the effect of technological density on technological diversification is greater than the effect of scientific and technological density.},

	abstract = {This dissertation seeks to answer three existing questions in general equilbrium theory and introduce a framework permitting for the extension of equilibrium analysis to a new class of models.
								
Models with uncertainty at the aggregate and idiosyncratic level have become standard within macroeconomics due to their greater explanatory power. In 1998, Per Krusell and
								
Anthony Smith laid the foundation that permitted much of this work to take place by introducing a theoretical framework featuring such shocks but which was also amenable to study via practical numerical
								
methods. Existence of equilibrium in their model was not formally analyzed until Jianjun Miao studied the problem in 2006; unfortunately, arguments presented
								
therein have important complications. First, we provide a correct, and novel, proof for the existence of sequential equilibrium in the
								
Krusell-Smith model. An extension of the model to include economies with endogenous labor choices and non-zero borrowing will then be developed.
								
Within the literature, an important working assumption is the existence of stochastic processes featuring conditional-no-aggregate-uncertainty (CNAU). This requirement that the empirical distribution of the idiosyncratic and
								
aggregate shock processes depend only on realizations of the aggregate shock process can be easily met when there are countably many agents by the law of large numbers, but for a continuum of agents arguments
								
of the type will not work. As such, we will provide two methods for constructing processes featuring CNAU in a general setting.
								
Practicality and behavioral demands also make it important for sequential equilibria to be reproducible via the recursively optimal behavior of agents who have a sufficiently simple set of state variables.
								
In this vein, we will propose an intuitive and sufficient state variable that allows for the replication at least some sequential equilibria, while making savings in the
								
informational demands placed on actors; thereby, giving an affirmative answer to a weakened formulation of the existence of recursive equilibria question.
								
Finally, we present an equilibrium framework for economies featuring rational inattention. In particular, we will study the behavior of agents who face
								
information constraints regarding the observation of shocks and prices in a production economy and present an existence result.},

From this we obtain equivalence between the Concede-and-Divide (Aumann and Maschler, 1985) sharing method for the bankruptcy problem and the Fair Division solution (Thompson, 1981) for the assignment problem. In bankruptcy problems, the minimal rights of a claimant is what is left of the endowment when all claimants but himself have received their full claims. By the Minimal Rights First property, it is irrelevant if we distribute the minimal rights first or proceed on the original problem. By adapting the property to the assignment problem, we obtain two characterizations of the Fair Division solution.},

We argue that framing climate negotiations as a classical conflicting claims problem (O’Neill Math Soc Sci 2(4):345–371, 1982) may provide for an effective climate policy. We analyze the allocation of the global carbon budget among parties claiming the maximum emissions rights possible.

In an experimental setting, we distribute endowments unequally among a group of people who can reach a fixed target sum through successive money contributions, knowing that if they fail, they will lose all their remaining money with 50\% probability. In some treatments, we give players the option to communicate intended contributions. We find that inequality reduces the prospects of reaching the target but that communication increases success dramatically. Successful groups tend to eliminate inequality over the course of the game, with rich players signaling willingness to redistribute early on. Our results suggest that coordination-promoting institutions and early redistribution from richer to poorer nations are both decisive for the avoidance of global calamities, such as disruptive climate change.},

An additional cause of conflict in such social dilemmas is heterogeneity. Cultural differences or financial inequity often interfere with decision making when a diverse group of individuals interact. We address these issues in situations where individuals are either rich or poor. Often, it is unclear how rich and poor individuals should interact – should the poor invest the same as the rich, or should the rich assist the poor? Which distribution of efforts can be considered as fair? To address the effects of heterogeneity on decisions, we model a collective-risk dilemma where players collectively have to invest more than a certain threshold, with heterogeneity and multiple rounds. We aim to understand the natural behavior and to infer which strategies are particularly stable in such asymmetric collective-risk games. Large scale individual based simulations show that when the poor players have half of the wealth the rich players posses, the poor contribute only when early contributions are made by the rich players. The rich contribute on behalf of the poor only when their own external assets are worth protecting. Under a certain degree of uncertainty we observe the rich maintain cooperation by assisting the poor.},

Nevertheless, countries’ current climate pledges are insufficient to achieve the agreement’s goal of keeping global mean temperature rise “well below” 2 ∘C. It is apparent that climate negotiators need to be equipped with additional strategies for fostering cooperation if a climate catastrophe is to be averted. We review the results arising from an emerging literature in which the problem of avoiding dangerous climate change has been simulated using cooperation experiments in which individuals play a game requiring collective action to avert a catastrophe. This literature has uncovered five key variables that influence the likelihood of avoiding disaster: (1) the perceived risk of collective failure, (2) inequalities in historical responsibility, wealth, and risk exposure, (3) uncertainty surrounding the threshold for catastrophe, (4) intergenerational discounting, and (5) the prospect of reward or punishment based on reputation. Along with the results of a recent experimental assessment of the key instruments of the Paris Agreement, we consider how knowledge of the effects of these variables might be harnessed by climate negotiators to improve the prospects of reaching a solution to global climate change.},

	abstract = {In cooperative endeavors among economically heterogeneous parties, the contribution decisions can often be framed in different ways. But do such framing differences affect behavior? We report the results of a laboratory experiment on threshold public goods with heterogeneous endowments and different frames. Four treatments frame two variables, each in one of two ways: the contribution metric is expressed either in absolute terms or relative to endowments, and the contribution choice is framed as either keeping or contributing some of one’s endowment. Subjects can exchange proposals and counterproposals. Our results reveal a broad consensus that high endowed subjects contribute more in absolute terms than the low endowed, which we trace to subjects’ reported distributive preferences. Both high and low endowed subjects contribute about two-thirds of their endowments in all treatments – save when the metric is framed as “contributing” in “absolute” terms: then the low endowed contribute significantly more, around 80\%. This last result suggests the possibility that the most frequently used frame in public good experiments induces higher contributions among the less affluent than economically equivalent alternate frames.},

Through a series of experiments, we show that the presence of an intermediary increases public good success and subjects’ earnings only when the intermediary is formally committed to direct donations to socially beneficial goods. Without such a restriction, the presence of an intermediary has a negative impact, complicating the donation environment, decreasing contributions and public good success.},

	abstract = {A systematic, rigorous, comprehensive, and unified overview of evolutionary game theory.This text offers a systematic, rigorous, and unified presentation of evolutionary game theory, covering the core developments of the theory from its inception in biology in the 1970s through recent advances. Evolutionary game theory, which studies the behavior of large populations of strategically interacting agents, is used by economists to make predictions in settings where traditional assumptions about agents' rationality and knowledge may not be justified. Recently, computer scientists, transportation scientists, engineers, and control theorists have also turned to evolutionary game theory, seeking tools for modeling dynamics in multiagent systems. Population Games and Evolutionary Dynamics provides a point of entry into the field for researchers and students in all of these disciplines. The text first considers population games, which provide a simple, powerful model for studying strategic interactions among large numbers of anonymous agents. It then studies the dynamics of behavior in these games.By introducing a general model of myopic strategy revision by individual agents, the text provides foundations for two distinct approaches to aggregate behavior dynamics: the deterministic approach, based on differential equations, and the stochastic approach, based on Markov processes. Key results on local stability, global convergence, stochastic stability, and nonconvergence are developed in detail. Ten substantial appendixes present the mathematical tools needed to work in evolutionary game theory, offering a practical introduction to the methods of dynamic modeling. Accompanying the text are more than 200 color illustrations of the mathematics and theoretical results; many were created using the Dynamo software suite, which is freely available on the author's Web site. Readers are encouraged to use Dynamo to run quick numerical experiments and to create publishable figures for their own research.},

We go on to provide evidence suggesting that one's own trustworthiness can be traced back to the values parents transmit to their children during their upbringing.},

As countries change their export mix, there is a strong tendency to move towards related goods rather than to goods that are farther away. The pattern of relatedness of products is only very partially explained by similarity in broad factor or technological intensities, suggesting that the relevant determinants are much more product-specific. Moreover, the pattern of relatedness of products exhibits very strong heterogeneity: there are parts of this ‘product space’ that are dense while others are sparse. This implies that countries that are specialized in a dense part of the product space have an easier time at changing their revealed comparative advantage than countries that are specialized in more disconnected products.},

We find that in such a setting, rule-based classification performs about as well as manual human coding in terms of precision and sensitivity, while being much more labor-saving. Hence, we share our insights on how to efficiently implement such a rule-based approach. To address scholars with a background in data analytics as well as those without, we provide non-technical explanations and open-source sample code that is free to use and adapt.},

The new synthesis is an empirical principle describing the probability that a region enters—or exits—an economic activity as a function of the number of related activities present in that location. In this paper we summarize some of the recent empirical evidence that has generalized the principle of relatedness to a fact describing the entry and exit of products, industries, occupations, and technologies, at the national, regional, and metropolitan scales. We conclude by describing some of the policy implications and future avenues of research implied by this robust empirical principle.},

The authors of The Atlas of Economic Complexity offer readers an explanation based on "Economic Complexity," a measure of a society's productive knowledge. Prosperous societies are those that have the knowledge to make a larger variety of more complex products. The Atlas of Economic Complexity attempts to measure the amount of productive knowledge countries hold and how they can move to accumulate more of it by making more complex products.Through the graphical representation of the "Product Space," the authors are able to identify each country's "adjacent possible," or potential new products, making it easier to find paths to economic diversification and growth. In addition, they argue that a country's economic complexity and its position in the product space are better predictors of economic growth than many other well-known development indicators, including measures of competitiveness, governance, finance, and schooling.Using innovative visualizations, the book locates each country in the product space, provides complexity and growth potential rankings for 128 countries, and offers individual country pages with detailed information about a country's current capabilities and its diversification options. The maps and visualizations included in the Atlas can be used to find more viable paths to greater productive knowledge and prosperity.},

The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or “product space,” finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.
Network analysis of the products made by rich and poor countries show that movement toward higher-profit products may be restricted for much of the developing world.

	abstract = {Models formulated as complementarity problems have been applied previously to assess the potential for market power in transmission-constrained electricity markets. Here, we use the complementarity approach to simulate the interaction of pollution permit markets with electricity markets, considering forward contracts and the operating reserve market. Because some power producers are relatively large consumers of permits, there could be interaction between market power in the permits and energy markets. Market power in the energy market is modeled using a Cournot game, while a conjectured price response model is used in the permits market. An illustrative application is made to Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM), which we represent by a 14-node dc load-flow model, and the USEPA Ozone Transport Commission NO/sub x/ Budget Program. The results show that forward contracts effectively mitigate market power in PJM energy market and both simulated solutions of perfect and Cournot (oligopoly) competition are a good approximation to actual prices in 2000, except that the Cournot model yielded higher peak prices. The NO/sub x/ market influences the Cournot energy market in several ways. One is that Cournot competition lowers the price of NO/sub x/ permits, which in turn affects on low- and high-emission producers differently. In general, because pollution permits are an important cost, high concentration in the market for such permits can exacerbate the effects of market power in energy markets.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide allowance trading systems for electricity generators are in place in the European Union and in several U.S. states. An important question in the design of such systems is how allowances are to be initially allocated: by auction, by giving away fixed amounts (grandfathering), or by allocating based on present or recent output, investment, or other decisions. The latter system can bias investment, operations, and product pricing decisions and increase costs relative to the other systems. A nonlinear complementarity model is proposed for investigating the long-run equilibria that would result under alternative systems for power markets characterized by time-varying demand and multiple technology types. Existence of equilibria is shown under mild conditions. Solutions for simple systems show that allocating allowances to new capacity based on fuel use or generator type can yield large distortions in capacity investment, invert the operating order of power plants, and inflate consumer costs. The distortions can be smaller for tighter CO2 restrictions and are somewhat mitigated if there is also a market for electricity capacity or minimum-run restrictions on coal plants. Distortions are also less if allowances are allocated to plants in proportion to sales rather than capacity.},

	abstract = {This article reports small group experiments in which subjects may choose to contribute a fixed amount of money toward a monetary public good, and in which the good itself is supplied only if a specified number of contributions (or more) are made. Given the opportunity to communicate, our subjects organized themselves by specifying precisely the number of required contributors and who they would be. This organization, which we call designation of a minimal contributing set, always resulted in provision of the public good, and provision in a nearly optimal manner. In contrast, groups presented with the identical problem but not allowed to communicate failed to generate a sufficient number of contributions 35 percent of the time, and in slightly over half of the successful groups, overprovision produced inefficiency. We present hypotheses about why designating a minimal contributing set works, and data indicating that the mechanism results in reduced normative conflict and felt risk, as well as increased efficiency. The essential property of the minimal contributing set, we hypothesize, is criticalness: the contributions of the members of the minimal contributing set are each critical to obtaining the public good the members desire, and they know it. It is reasonable (albeit not a dominant strategy) to contribute because reasonable behavior can be expected from other minimal contributing set members who are in the same situation. Unreasonableness is a problem that increases with the size of groups, but adaptations exist that, we argue, can reduce its seriousness.},

Our main finding is that in a complete risk market---when all uncertainties can be replicated by financial products---a risky design equilibrium problem collapses to what we call a risky design game, i.e., a stochastic Nash game in which the original design agents act as risk neutral and there emerges an additional system risk agent. The system risk agent simultaneously prices risk and determines the probability density used by the other agents for their risk neutral evaluations. This situation is stochastic-endogenous: the probability density used by agents to value uncertain investments is endogenous to the risky design equilibrium problem. This result is most striking when design agents use coherent risk measures in which case the intersection of their risk sets turns out to be a risk set for the system risk agent, thereby extending existing results for risk markets. We also investigate existence of equilibria in both the complete and incomplete cases.},

These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs. Development of new risk trading mechanisms to replace or complement current capacity obligations could lead to more efficient outcomes.},

The competition and risk that now prevail in the sector may require a more refined analysis. We consider a competitive market with agents investing in some mix of capacities: the risk exposure of a plant and the attitude towards risk of the owner depend on the plant and the portfolio of its capacities. They may also depend on hedging contracts acquired by the investor on the market if such contracts exist. We represent these effects through equilibrium models of generation capacity in incomplete markets. The models come in different versions depending on the portfolio of physical plants and hedging contracts. These modify the long-term risk of the plants, the attitude of the owners towards risk, and hence the incentive to invest. The models involve risk-averse producers and consumers, and their behavior is represented by convex risk measures. We use degree theory to prove existence and explore multiplicity of equilibrium solutions.},

To do this, we have formulated and implemented an optimization model based on a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal expansion plan considering the installation of both large-scale power plants and renewable-based distributed generation. An important characteristic of the proposed model is that it includes a detailed formulation of the power system. Moreover, differently than existing literature, special attention is given to the analysis of the spatial-temporal distributive effects of pollutant taxes, considering both global and local pollutant emissions. The method is applied to the main Chilean power system. Our results indicate that global and local pollutant taxes significantly impact both planning and operational decisions in the power system. In particular, pollutant taxes may have significant spatial distributive effects, as shown in the analysis of 13 regions of Chile, leading to damages in some specific regions while relatively benefiting others. Our results also show that the availability of renewable energy capacity may improve the effectiveness of pollutant taxes. Particularly, adding 1.5 GW of hydro capacity to the Chilean system allows avoiding around 32 GWh of fossil fuel generation per year, saving more than 1.5 billion US\$ in the 10-year horizon considered. The proposed method and qualitative results are sufficiently generic to apply to any other jurisdiction.},

The paper postulates the conceptually useful allegory of a futuristic ‘World Climate Assembly’ (WCA) that votes for a single worldwide price on carbon emissions via the basic democratic principle of one person, one vote majority rule. A WCA-like uniform price-tax counters self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality because each WCA agent's higher abatement cost from a higher emissions price is counterbalanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. The paper derives fresh insights and new simple formulae that relate each emitter's most-preferred world price of carbon to the world ‘social cost of carbon’ (SCC), and further relates the WCA-voted world price of carbon to the world SCC. Some implications are discussed. The overall methodology of the paper is a mixture of mostly classical with some behavioural economics.},

	abstract = {In real situations, people are often faced with the option of voluntary contribution to achieve a collective goal, for example, building a dam or a fence, in order to avoid an unfavorable loss. Those who do not donate, however, can free ride on others' sacrifices. As a result, cooperation is difficult to maintain, leading to an enduring collective-risk social dilemma. To address this issue, here we propose a simple yet effective theoretical model of threshold public goods game with collective risk and focus on the effect of risk on the emergence of social cooperation. To do this, we consider the population dynamics represented by replicator equation for two simplifying scenarios, respectively: one with fair sharers, who contribute the minimum average amount versus defectors and the other with altruists contributing more than average versus defectors. For both cases, we find that the dilemma is relieved in high-risk situations where cooperation is likely to persist and dominate defection in the population. Large initial endowment to individuals also encourages the risk-averse action, which means that, as compared to poor players (with small initial endowment), wealthy individuals (with large initial endowment) are more likely to cooperate in order to protect their private accounts. In addition, we show that small donation amount and small threshold (collective target) can encourage and sustain cooperation. Furthermore, for other parameters fixed, the impacts of group size act differently on the two scenarios because of distinct mechanisms: in the former case where the cost of cooperation depends on the group size, large size of group readily results in defection, while easily maintains cooperation in the latter case where the cost of cooperation is fixed irrespective of the group size. Our theoretical results of the replicator dynamics are in excellent agreement with the individual based simulation results.},

Theory is ambiguous on the equilibrium coalition size and contribution rates. We examine the emergence of coalitions, their size, and how uncertainty in public goods provision affects contribution levels and coalition size. We find that contributions decrease when public good returns are uncertain but increase when individuals can form a coalition to provide the good. Contrary a core theoretical result, we find that coalition size increases when the public good benefits are higher. Uncertainty has no effect on coalition size.},

This new, updated edition keeps pace with industry trends and advances as well as with the changing interests and needs of students, practitioners, and researchers. As before, every chapter has been written to stand on its own, providing sufficient background for the reader to follow the argument without referring to other chapters--allowing readers to selectively choose those chapters that are most relevant to a particular course, interest, or issue.   The Nonprofit Sector: A Research Handbook includes twenty-seven new or updated chapters. Relevant chapters from the previous edition have been refined, and new chapters have been added to fill in gaps, making this the authoritative reference for all who want an accessible, perceptive, and all-inclusive rendering of the nonprofit sector. The contributors--prominent scholars in their respective fields--carefully reflect upon the variety of changes in the rapidly growing world of nonprofits, examining a wide array of organizations, international issues, social science theories, and philanthropic traditions and covering a broad range of topics including the history and scope of nonprofit activities in the United States and abroad, the relation of nonprofits to the marketplace, government-nonprofit issues, key activities of nonprofits, aspects of giving to and joining nonprofits, and nonprofit mission and governance. For anyone who wishes to have a deeper understanding of the nonprofit sector, this remains the essential guide.  From reviews of the first edition: "[This book] is the closest thing to a 'bible' of nonprofit sector research and state-of-the-art social science knowledge as currently exists."--Dennis R.

A money-back guarantee further encourages provision, especially when the threshold is high. A high threshold discourages provision in the absence, but not in the presence of a money-back guarantee. High rewards also significantly increase contributions and provision. Sufficiently high rewards elicit convergence of contributions to the threshold, rather than the deterioration towards free riding, often reported in previous studies.},

	abstract = {In the social capital literature a distinction is made between trust expressed in people in general, and trust in people who are known to us personally. In this article we investigate the frames of reference respondents make use of when answering two commonly used interpersonal trust questions. Half of our sample was administered a version which asks respondents whether "most people" can be trusted. The other half of the sample was administered an alternative version of the question, in which the object of trust is restricted to "people in your local area." Immediately after answering the trust question all respondents were asked to report, in their own words, who came to mind when formulating their response. Counter to the widespread assumption that these questions measure generalized trust, we find that a substantial number of respondents report having thought about people who are known to them personally. Furthermore, respondents who report having thought about individuals who are known to them also report substantially higher levels of trust than people who say they thought about abstract categories such as "people in general." Our results suggest that apparent differences in trust across question formats and groups within the general public derive, at least in part, from heterogeneity in question interpretation.

	abstract = {Pupillometry (or the measurement of pupil size) is commonly used as an index of cognitive load and arousal. Pupil size data are recorded using eyetracking devices that provide an output containing pupil size at various points in time. During blinks the eyetracking device loses track of the pupil, resulting in missing values in the output file. The missing-sample time window is preceded and followed by a sharp change in the recorded pupil size, due to the opening and closing of the eyelids. This eyelid signal can create artificial effects if it is not removed from the data. Thus, accurate detection of the onset and the offset of blinks is necessary for pupil size analysis. Although there are several approaches to detecting and removing blinks from the data, most of these approaches do not remove the eyelid signal or can result in a relatively large amount of data loss. The present work suggests a novel blink detection algorithm based on the fluctuations that characterize pupil data. These fluctuations (“noise”) result from measurement error produced by the eyetracker device. Our algorithm finds the onset and offset of the blinks on the basis of this fluctuation pattern and its distinctiveness from the eyelid signal. By comparing our algorithm to three other common blink detection methods and to results from two independent human raters, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in detecting blink onset and offset. The algorithm’s code and example files for processing multiple eye blinks are freely available for download (https://osf.io/jyz43).},

We first show theoretically that a perceived increase in charities’ qualities represents a decrease in the price of charitable output, which could generate both an income and substitution effect on nominal giving. On the one hand positive news about charities’ qualities can increase giving, since donors realize that it is cheaper to generate charitable output. On the other hand positive news can reduce nominal giving because a smaller donation can generate an equal or higher level of charitable output. We then hypothesize and test that such negative income effect may be dominant among image-motivated donors whenever the quality of giving has a social signaling value: donors can “give less, but show that they give smart”. We find that when information is public, 34\% of donors trade-off the quality and quantity of their donations. We show that these donors are relatively more motivated by social recognition, and strategically use positive public information to give less. The effect of public information is causal: when information about charities’ qualities is privately received, giving is always increasing in the quality of the news, and bad news has no effect on giving.},

	abstract = {There is a widely held view within the general public that large corporations should act in the interests of a broader group of agents than just their shareholders (the stakeholder view). This paper presents a framework where this idea can be justified. The point of departure is the observation that a large firm typically faces endogenous risks that may have a significant impact on the workers it employs and the consumers it serves. These risks generate externalities on these stakeholders which are not internalized by shareholders. As a result, in the competitive equilibrium, there is under-investment in the prevention of these risks. We suggest that this under-investment problem can be alleviated if firms are instructed to maximize the total welfare of their stakeholders rather than shareholder value alone (stakeholder equilibrium). The stakeholder equilibrium can be implemented by introducing new property rights (employee rights and consumer rights) and instructing managers to maximize the total value of the firm (the value of these rights plus shareholder value). If there is only one firm, the stakeholder equilibrium is Pareto optimal. However, this is not true with more than one firm and/or heterogeneous agents, which illustrates some of the limits of the stakeholder model.},

In the unique symmetric equilibrium, the only individuals who make positive contributions are those who most value the public good and who are also the most pessimistic; that is, according to their beliefs, the proportion of players who most like the public good is smaller than it would be according to any other possible belief. We predict whether the aggregate contribution is larger or smaller than it would be in an analogous game with complete information and heterogeneous preferences, by comparing the beliefs of contributors with the true distribution of preferences. A trade-off between preferences and beliefs arises if there is no individual who simultaneously has the highest preference type and the most pessimistic belief. In this case, there is a symmetric equilibrium, and multiple symmetric equilibria occur only if there are more than two preference types.},

Despite the relatively sparse data requirements and the minimal assumptions about preferences and technology, these restrictions are not vacuous.

	abstract = {A large economics literature seeks to understand the reasons why individuals make charitable contributions. Fundamental features of most models of charitable giving are the inclusion of externalities induced by other agents and the Lancasterian characteristics approach to specifying utility functions. This paper develops a general, revealed-preference methodology for testing a variety of preference structures that allow for both externalities and characteristics. The tests are simple linear programs that are transparent, computationally efficient, and straightforward to implement. We show how the technique applies to standard models of privately provided public goods and novel models that account for other-regarding preferences based on relative consumption and donations among individuals. We also conduct an original experiment that enables testing and comparing many models on a single data set. Our experiment design allows us to focus on intrinsic motivations which are often hard to disentangle from other extrinsic or image effects in field data. The results provide the first revealed-preference evidence on the importance of social comparisons when individuals make charitable contributions. Models that include preferences for either relative consumption or donations yield significantly greater explanatory power than the standard model of impure altruism.},

The bottom layer finds, for a given C\&T policy, equilibrium bidding strategies of the competing generators while maximizing social welfare via a DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) model. We refer to this layer as policy evaluation. The top layer (called policy optimization) involves design of Pareto optimal C\&T policies over a planning horizon. The performance measures that are considered for the purpose of design are social welfare and the corresponding system marginal price (MP), CO2 emissions, and electricity consumption level.},

The models lost some of their appeal at the inception of restructuring even though they still offer a lot of possibilities and are in many respect irreplaceable provided they are adapted to the new environment. We introduce stochastic equilibrium versions of these models that we believe provide a relevant context for looking at the current very risky market where the power industry invests and operates. We then take up different questions raised by the new environment. Some are due to developments of the industry like demand side management: an optimization framework has difficulties accommodating them but the more general equilibrium paradigm offers additional possibilities. We then look at the insertion of risk-related investment practices that developed with the new environment and may not be easy to accommodate in an optimization context. Specifically we consider the use of plant-specific discount rates that we derive by including stochastic discount rates in the equilibrium model. Linear discount factors only price systematic risk. We therefore complete the discussion by inserting different risk functions (for different agents) in order to account for additional unpriced idiosyncratic risk in investments. These different models can be cast in a single mathematical representation but they do not have the same mathematical properties. We illustrate the impact of these phenomena on a small but realistic example.},

In this paper, we shall distinguish between two types of knowledge base: analytical and synthetic. These types indicate different mixes of tacit and codified knowledge, codification possibilities and limits, qualifications and skills, required organisations and institutions involved, as well as specific competitive challenges from a globalising economy, which have different implications for different sectors of industry, and, thus, for the kind of innovation support needed. The traditional constellation of industrial clusters surrounded by innovation supporting organisations, constituting a regional innovation system, is nearly always to be found in contexts of industries with a synthetic knowledge base (e.g. engineering-based industries), while the existence of regional innovation systems as an integral part of a cluster will normally be the case of industries-based on an analytical knowledge base (e.g. science-based industries, such as IT and bio-tech). In the discussion of different types of regional innovation systems five empirical illustrations from a Nordic comparative project on SMEs and regional innovation systems will be used: the furniture industry in Salling, Denmark; the wireless communication industry in North Jutland, Denmark; the functional food industry in Scania, Sweden; the food industry in Rogaland, Norway and the electronics industry in Horten, Norway. We argue that in terms of innovation policy the regional level often provides a grounded approach embedded in networks of actors acknowledging the importance of the knowledge base of an industry.},

Our arguments include a new and general result on the existence of linear price equilibrium with multiple markets. Each market has its own price vector (linear functional), and agents’ involvement in various markets is heterogeneous. As a result, price differences across markets may prevail in equilibrium. We present an example in which single market linear price equilibrium does not exist, but certain corresponding equilibrium with two markets does. This example is a particular instance of a prevalent nonexistence problem in atomless economies with differential information. Bypassing the nonexistence problem is one of the achievements of the nonlinear equilibrium theory. Our equilibrium with multiple markets, on the other hand, offers a solution with a more standard economic interpretation. Besides, our general framework is a model of multiple markets in their own right, and our results are related to the role of economic intermediation and bilateral trade.},

The index is estimated for 17 countries of the region at two points in time—one around 2005 and the other around 2012. Overall, we estimate about 28 percent of people are multidimensionally poor in 2012 in the region. We find statistically significant reductions of poverty in most countries, both in terms of incidence and intensity over the period under analysis. However, important disparities between rural and urban areas remain. Statistical scrutiny of the index suggests that it captures the state of poverty relatively well while maintaining a certain parsimony and being highly robust to changes in weights, indicators, and poverty cut-off.},

	abstract = {This paper sets out a systemic account of intertemporal changes in multidimensional poverty using the Alkire–Foster Adjusted Headcount Ratio and its consistent sub-indices. It uses three techniques to assess the pro-poorness of multidimensional poverty reduction. The analysis of changes in multidimensional poverty draws on the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and related destitution measure in 34 countries and 338 sub-national regions, covering 2.5 billion people, for which there is a recent MPI estimation and comparable Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across time. First, it assesses overall changes in poverty and its incidence and intensity, and compares this with changes in \$1.90 poverty. Next, utilizing the property of subgroup decomposability, it examines changes in the MPI and its consistent sub-indices over time across urban–rural regions, sub-national regions and ethnic groups. The decomposition analysis identifies relevant national patterns, including those in which the pace of poverty reduction is higher for the poorest subgroups. Finally, the paper analyzes the dynamics of a strict subset of the poor, who are identified as “destitute” using a more extreme deprivation cutoff vector, and studies relative rates of reduction of destitution and poverty by country and region. This extensive empirical analysis illustrates how to assess the extent and patterns of reduction of multidimensional poverty, as well as whether it is inclusive or whether some people or groups are left behind. Naturally, some further research questions emerge.},

	abstract = {Many authors have insisted on the necessity of defining poverty as a multidimensional concept rather than relying on income or consumption expenditures per capita. Yet, not much has actually been done to include the various dimensions of deprivation into the practical definition and measurement of poverty. Existing attempts along that direction consist of aggregating various attributes into a single index through some arbitrary function and defining a poverty line and associated poverty measures on the basis of that index. This is merely redefining more generally the concept of poverty, which then essentially remains a one dimensional concept. The present paper suggests that an alternative way to take into account the multi-dimensionality of poverty is to specify a poverty line for each dimension of poverty and to consider that a person is poor if he/she falls below at least one of these various lines. The paper then explores how to combine these various poverty lines and associated one-dimensional gaps into multidimensional poverty measures. An application of these measures to the rural population in Brazil is also given with poverty defined on income and education.},

In recent work we have attempted to offer a practical approach to identifying the poor and measuring aggregate poverty (Alkire and Foster, J Public Econ, 2011). As this is quite a departure from traditional unidimensional and multidimensional poverty measurement—particularly with respect to the identification step—further elaboration may be warranted. In this paper we elucidate the strengths, limitations, and misunderstandings of multidimensional poverty measurement in order to clarify the debate and catalyse further research. We begin with general definitions of unidimensional and multidimensional methodologies for measuring poverty. We provide an intuitive description of our measurement approach, including a ‘dual cutoff’ identification step that views poverty as the state of being multiply deprived, and an aggregation step based on the traditional FGT measures. We briefly discuss five characteristics of our methodology that are easily overlooked or mistaken and conclude with some brief remarks on the way forward.},

	abstract = {The co-evolutionary dynamics of competing populations can be strongly affected by frequency-dependent selection and spatial population structure. As co-evolving populations grow into a spatial domain, their initial spatial arrangement and their growth rate differences are important factors that determine the long-term outcome. We here model producer and free-rider co-evolution in the context of a diffusive public good (PG) that is produced by the producers at a cost but evokes local concentration-dependent growth benefits to all. The benefit of the PG can be non-linearly dependent on public good concentration. We consider the spatial growth dynamics of producers and free-riders in one, two and three dimensions by modeling producer cell, free-rider cell and public good densities in space, driven by the processes of birth, death and diffusion (cell movement and public good distribution). Typically, one population goes extinct, but the time-scale of this process varies with initial conditions and the growth rate functions. We establish that spatial variation is transient regardless of dimensionality, and that structured initial conditions lead to increasing times to get close to an extinction state, called ε-extinction time. Further, we find that uncorrelated initial spatial structures do not influence this ε-extinction time in comparison to a corresponding well-mixed (non-spatial) system. In order to estimate the ε-extinction time of either free-riders or producers we derive a slow manifold solution. For invading populations, i.e. for populations that are initially highly segregated, we observe a traveling wave, whose speed can be calculated. Our results provide quantitative predictions for the transient spatial dynamics of cooperative traits under pressure of extinction.},

The fulsome, up-to-date bibliography is accompanied by a marvellous collection of nearly 700 exercises (with integrated hints): for both learners and lecturers, this rich source of material alone is worth more than the cost of the book. … I warmly commend this book … ." (Nick Lord, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 87 (509), 2003) "This book, which contains a vast amount of material, is intended as an introduction to linear function analysis … . At the end of each chapter there is a wealth of beautiful applications and exercises … . I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the study of Banach spaces … . I think it would be fair to say that if one knew half of the material contained in this book, then one would know quite a lot." (Warren Moors, The Australian Mathematical Society Gazette, Vol. 29 (5), 2002) "This book is based on graduate courses taught at the university of Alberta in Edmonton. It is intended as an introduction to linear functional analysis and to some parts of infinite-dimensional Banach space theory. It is full of facts, theorems, corollaries; along with a large number of exercises with detailed hints for their solution. … The authors have accomplished a text which is easily readable and as self-contained as possible. A very excellent book for the topics covered." (Joe Howard, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 981, 2002) "By its organization, the book can be used as a textbook for various types of courses in functional analysis … . Besides classical material, the book contains also some recent and more specialized results … . The book contains a large number of exercises with detailed hints, completing the main text with many important results. The book is a valuable contribution to Banach space literature and can be used as a solid introduction to functional analysis … ." (Stefan Cobzas, Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai Mathematica, Vol. XLVII (2), 2002) "The present book is … intended as an introduction to linear functional analysis … . Each chapter concludes with a separate section in which together nearly 700 exercises are listed. Almost all of them, as it seems, are supplemented with hints to their solution. The exercises are an important part of the general text, contain many important results and essentially complement the material in the chapters. … Altogether, the material presented is simply enormous and could fill with enthusiasm … ."

We then show that a competitive equilibrium exists for infinite-horizon economies when credit markets are composed of finite-lived contracts or infinite-lived contracts that can be refinanced over time. Finally, we show that if credit markets include infinite-lived contracts that cannot be refinanced, an equilibrium exists when per-period utility functions are either additive in at least one commodity or satisfy a substitution condition, which holds for unbounded per-period utility functions. We illustrate our contributions by providing examples of economies that conform with the assumptions of each of our equilibrium existence results.},

As such, marginal industry behavior is identical to that of a for-profit industry and nonprofit regulations may have a limited impact or even no impact on overall industry performance. Our theory has the methodological advantage that standard for-profit analysis applies directly to nonprofit firms, because they can be analyzed as for-profit firms with lower costs.

Besley and Ghatak (2001) have argued that in an incomplete contracting framework, the party who values the public good most should be the owner. We show that this conclusion relies on their assumption that the parties split the renegotiation surplus 50:50. If the generalized Nash bargaining solution is applied, then for any pair of valuations that the two parties may have, there exist bargaining powers such that either ownership by the government or by the NGO can be optimal.},

We present a set of simple (graph-theoretic, ordinal) axioms that are satisfied by PageRank, and moreover any page ranking algorithm that does satisfy them must coincide with PageRank. This is the first representation theorem of that kind, bridging the gap between page ranking algorithms and the mathematical theory of social choice.},

As such, there are various reasonable ranking methods, each one of them more or less adapted to the environment under consideration. This paper introduces a new method, called the handicap-based method, and characterizes it through appealing properties. This method assigns not only scores to the items, but also weights to the experts. Scores and weights form an equilibrium for a relationship based on the notion of handicaps. The method is, in a sense made precise in the paper, the counterpart to the counting method in environments that require intensity invariance. Intensity invariance is a desirable property when the intensity of the experts' statements has to be controlled. Otherwise, both the counting and the handicap-based methods satisfy a property called homogeneity, which is a desirable property when cardinal statements matter, as is the case in many applications.},

Despite many theoretical studies on ambiguity in game theory, empirical studies have lagged behind due to a lack of measurement methods, where separating ambiguity attitudes from beliefs is crucial. Baillon et al. (Econometrica, 2018b) introduced a method that allows for such a separation for individual choice. We extend this method to strategic situations and apply it to the trust game, providing new insights. People’s ambiguity attitudes and beliefs both matter for their trust decisions. People who are more ambiguity averse decide to trust less, and people with more optimistic beliefs about others’ trustworthiness decide to trust more. However, people who are more a-insensitive (insufficient discrimination between different likelihood levels) are less likely to act upon their beliefs. Our measurement of beliefs, free from contamination by ambiguity attitudes, shows that traditional introspective trust survey measures capture trust in the commonly accepted sense of belief in trustworthiness of others. Further, trustworthy people also decide to trust more due to their beliefs that others are similar to themselves. This paper shows that applications of ambiguity theories to game theory can bring useful new empirical insights.},

	abstract = {There is now considerable empirical evidence demonstrating the innovation and performance benefits that accrue to firms engaging in open innovation (OI). Here, we use novel data on micro-businesses to show that the average level of engagement in OI falls well below the optimal level, a finding that reflects that of other empirical studies. We identify and examine three market failures which may help to explain this result. These relate to a lack of understanding of the potential benefits of OI by firms, a lack of information about the capabilities of potential partners and a lack of information about the trustworthiness of potential partners. Our findings provide evidence that policy initiatives designed to offset these information failures are likely to increase the range of partners with which firms engage with significant benefits for innovation.},

Or should we increase the income inequality? Inspired by this matter, we propose a payoff redistribution model and explore which case can evaluate the cooperative level in public goods game. Specifically, we use a single parameter α to control the above two scenarios. Positive α increases the income inequality between rich and poor, while negative α ensures this equality and the case of α = 0 turns our model to the symmetric case, where there is no payoff redistribution effect. Extensive simulation shows that when we narrow the gap between the rich and poor, cooperation can be maintained, conversely, if this income inequality is increased, the cooperative groups are destroyed. Our work thus provides a novel clue to explore this problem especially from the viewpoint of evolutionary game theory.},

Based on the ranking of neighbors’ highest payoffs, self-aspiration payoffs and self-current payoffs, a dynamic strategy updating rule reflecting the process of progressively pursuing higher payoffs is proposed to study the synergistic effects of inner desires and external environment on cooperation. The dynamic strategy updating rule includes local optima, imitation rule and self-optimization. We apply this updating method to the investor sharing game and conclude the level of cooperation increases under small aspiration levels. Through the simulation results, we find that self-optimization rule will increase the probability of defectors with high investment transforming into cooperators, who will promote the imitation of cooperation behaviors later. Meanwhile, both of the lower monopoly of markets and more random networks boost cooperation in groups. In addition, this dynamic nature of the strategy updating rule may provide an idea for studying mixing rules, multi-person games and the heterogeneity of individuals.},

We enrich this model in three ways: (1) We compare estimates obtained using a broader definition of innovation spending to those that use R\&D spending. (2) We assume that a firm simultaneously innovates and chooses among different appropriability methods to protect the innovation. (3) We estimate the impact of innovation output on firm productivity conditional on the choice of appropriability mechanism. We find that firms that innovate and rate formal methods for the protection of intellectual property highly are more productive than other firms, but that the same does not hold in the case of informal methods of protection, except possibly for large firms as opposed to SMEs. We also find that this result is strongest for firms in the services, trade, and utility sectors, and negative in the manufacturing sector.},

Further exploration reveals that our estimates capture a greater reluctance of foundation firms to initiate or rapidly increase shareholder payouts, but not a greater tendency to reduce or eliminate shareholder payouts. Additional analyses suggest managers direct funds that would have been paid out toward executive compensation and capital investment. In light of the fact that firms with foundations are more likely to exhibit a high degree of managerial entrenchment, we interpret these findings as evidence that foundations are both a sign of and vehicle for managerial self-dealing.},

Then we obtain new results by extending this line of research, examining whether donors have an aversion to specific types of overhead (specifically, salaries and fundraising). Our results suggest that donor behavior may be dependent on their outside option. If an overhead-free donation is readily available, then the average donor in our experiment (70–80\% of subjects) prefers that charity to receive the donation. However, if donations are not overhead-free, most (approximately two-thirds of subjects) prefer the donation go toward fundraising efforts instead of salary-related expenditures.},

First, the traditional model of the rational self-interested individual can explain voluntary contributions. Second, a public policy to encourage volunteerism would maintain private information of private contributions to the supply of public goods.

Propositions provide sufficient conditions for increased risk to worsen free-riding behavior in the two models. For Nash behavior, we also give the sufficient condition for increased risk to ameliorate free-riding behavior.

Under public production, public goods are produced by the government. Under public finance, the same amount of public goods is produced by cost-minimizing private providers with the government financing their costs. When the model is solved numerically using fiscal data from the UK, a switch from public production to public finance has substantial aggregate and distributional implications. Public providers cannot beat private providers, in terms of productive efficiency, even if they both act as cost minimizers. The following mix of reforms is found to be Pareto improving: (i) a transition to cost-minimizing private providers that allows the government to achieve efficiency savings, (ii) a reduction in distorting income taxes made affordable by these efficiency savings, and (iii) a mechanism to compensate the ex public employees. All these results hold if private producers use a more capital intensive production technology than public producers, or, even in the case in which they use the same technology, if capital is a relatively important productive factor quantitatively.},

Our results show that the Knack and Keefer results are only limitedly robust, whereas the results found by Zak and Knack are highly robust in terms of significance of the estimated coefficients and reasonably robust in terms of the estimated effect size. The improvement in robustness is caused by the inclusion of countries with relatively low scores on trust (most notably, the Philippines and Peru). Overall, our results point at a relatively important role for trust. However, the answer to the question how large this payoff actually is depends on the set of conditioning variables controlled for in the regression analysis and--to an even larger extent--on the underlying sample.

The “bandwidth” of trust--where trust and distrust are differentiated--can vary over time in the same relationship or coexist at the same time. Bandwidth types are deterrence-based trust, calculus-based trust, relational trust, and institution-based trust. Two conditions of trust are risk and interdependence.

On Smith's account, each party to a market transaction pursues his own interests, subject only to the law of contract. Using the work of Smith's contemporary Antonio Genovesi as our starting point, we reconstruct an alternative understanding of market interactions as instances of a wider class of reciprocal relationships in civil society, characterized by joint intentions for mutual assistance. We consider the implications of our arguments for current debates about whether marketed personal care services can be genuinely caring.},

	abstract = {In this book the author addresses the the standard theories of trust and articulates his own new idea: that much of what we call trust can be best described as "encapsulated interest." Research into the roles of trust in society has offered a broad range of often conflicting theories. Some theorists maintain that trust is a social virtue that cannot be reduced to strategic self-interest; others claim that trusting another person is ultimately a rational calculation based on information about that person and his or her incentives and motivations. The author argues that we place our trust in persons whom we believe to have strong reasons to act in our best interests. He claims that we are correct when we assume that the main incentive of those whom we trust is to maintain a relationship with us--whether it be for reasons of economic benefit or for love and friendship. The author articulates his theory by using examples from a broad array of personal and social relationships, paying particular attention to explanations of the development of trusting relationships. He also examines trustworthiness and seeks to understand why people may behave in ways that violate their own self-interest in order to honor commitments they have made to others.

Then comes an investigation of empirical work on the determinants of generalized trust, covering contributions focusing on the impact of civic society, quality of institutions, culture and values, and ethnic heterogeneity. In these studies, generalized trust is treated as the dependent variable. After that, I survey recent empirical work on societal impacts of generalized trust, covering research on the impact of generalized trust on economic outcomes, on politics and “good government,” and on the welfare state. Here, generalized trust is treated as an independent variable. I conclude with a short assessment of where we stand and how research on generalized trust may proceed from here.},

In the model presented here, the set of firms that form and the contractual arrangements that appear, the assignments of agents to firms, the prices faced by firms for inputs and outputs, and the incentives to agents are all determined endogenously at equilibrium. Agents choose consumption—but they also choose which firms to join, which roles to occupy in those firms, and which actions to take in those roles. Agents interact anonymously with the (large) market, but strategically within the (small) firms they join. The model accommodates moral hazard, adverse selection, signaling, and insurance. Equilibria may be Pareto ranked.},

This paper examines the role of the trends of GDP and of social trust in predicting the trends of well-being. We find that the strength of the relationship between social trust and SWB over the medium-term is comparable to that of GDP. We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor of the trends of SWB. However, in the short run the relationship between social trust and SWB does not hold and GDP stands out as the only significant correlate of SWB.},

We validate such survey measures in an incentivized public good experiment and show that they are importantly related to cooperation behavior in a large and heterogeneous sample. We provide evidence on the microfoundation of this relation by use of an experimental design that enables us to disentangle preferences for cooperation from beliefs about others' cooperation. Our analysis suggests that the standard trust question used in the World Values Survey is a proxy for cooperation preferences rather than beliefs about others' cooperation. In contrast, the “fairness question”, a recently proposed alternative to the standard trust question, seems to operate through beliefs rather than preferences.},

While some argue that economic growth leads to higher subjective well-being, and others argue that it does not, we are the first to specify two conditions that make economic growth compatible with subjective well-being over time: increasing social trust and declining income inequality. Our methodological contribution is to combine micro- and macro-level data from a large sample of developing, transition, and developed countries and to explicitly distinguish the cross-country differences from the changes over time. We perform a multilevel analysis of harmonized data composed of the World Values Survey, the European Values Study, and macro-level indicators of economic growth and income inequality for 46 countries, observed from 1981 to 2012. Our results show that in the long run economic growth improves subjective well-being when social trust does not decline and, in richer countries, when income inequality reduces. These results are compatible with the recommendation that, to pursue durable improvements in people’s subjective well-being, policy-makers should adopt a ”promote, protect and reduce” policy agenda: promote economic growth, protect and promote social trust, and reduce income inequality.},

There are personalized trading restrictions connecting prices with both portfolio constraints and consumption possibilities, a setting which has not thoroughly been addressed by the literature. Our approach is general enough to be compatible with incomplete market economies where there exist wealth-dependent and/or investment-dependent credit access, borrowing constraints precluding bankruptcy, or assets backed by physical collateral. To prove equilibrium existence, we assume that both investment on segmented assets is not required to obtain access to credit and transfers implementable in segmented markets can be super-replicated by investing in non-segmented markets. For instance, this super-replication property is satisfied if either (i) all individuals have access to borrow at a risk-free rate; or (ii) financial contracts make real promises in terms of non-perishable commodities; or (iii) promises are backed by physical collateral.},

Although collaborations are a valuable means to tackle complex social issues, NPOs also similarly collaborate with other NPOs for delivering socially responsible programs. However, the motivations driving NPOs to collaborate with likeminded organizations for socially responsible programs remain unclear. Using a single embedded in-depth case study research design, our purpose is to examine the formation of collaborations among sport federations and sport clubs for socially responsible programs. Reflecting the interplay between resource-based view and institutional perspectives, our findings intrinsically indicate that partners demonstrate similarity in their motivations to collaborate due to their organizational fit, but with some key differences in the complementary resources they seek. Organizational legitimacy and resource exchange needs for socially responsible programs are driving the collaboration rather than organizational survival needs. The potential to create social value makes this nonprofit collaboration form unique.},

This research fills a gap in the literature by contrasting the formation of loyalty in a developing nation, with the national culture in which the framework was initially developed. Findings indicate that while trust and commitment are significant in the formation of behavioral loyalty in both Latin America and the United States, this relationship is mediated by cognitive and affective loyalty. The respective contributions of affective and cognitive loyalty are, however, different based on cultural context. In Latin America, the model is more affectively focused, whereas in the United States it is more cognitively focused. Theoretical, practical and managerial implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Learning to read and write is a basic skill that unfortunately not everybody acquires sufficiently. Lack of teachers and time in school are some of the reasons, but in addition the enormous rise in informational activities due to the Internet and other information technology-enabled opportunities has made literacy skills increasingly important to ever more people. This means literacy education must be improved so more children in the world get better chances. In order to contribute to developing better methods for learning to read and write in early years this study tests a new method developed to improve reading and writing learning in early ages. The ICT (Information and communication technologies) supported “Integrated Write to Learn” (iWTR) method lets children in 1st grade use computers and other ICT tools to write texts and subsequently discuss and refine them together with class mates and teachers. Handwriting is postponed to 2nd grade. While the traditional method requires students to go through two development processes in parallel, a cognitive (learning to read and) a motor (learning to write with a pencil), iWTR works with one process at a time, first cognitive development, then (from grade 2) motor skills training. iWTR extends previous WTR methods by more social work methods using a web site and peer comment for providing social meaning and feedback. The method was tested using two test groups and two control groups (total n = 87) by systematically measuring performance in reading and writing using standard tests in combination with observations and student evaluation to assess social and individual effects of work methods. The results show that while reading skills were improved considerably the biggest improvement concerned writing skills. Students in the test group wrote longer texts with better structure, clearer content, and a more elaborate language.},

We extend the framework of Nitzan and Fershtman and include a diffusion term. We consider two cases. In the first case, the volatility of the diffusion term is dependent on the current level of the public good. This set-up will in principle lead to the same type of feedback strategies computed under certainty. In the second case, the volatility is dependent on the current rate of public good provision by the agents. The results are qualitatively different. We provide a detailed discussion as well as numerical examples. In particular, we show that in both cases uncertainty signifies the free rider effect.},

The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased coordination problem.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of competitive equilibrium for a warm-glow economy (henceforth, warm-glow equilibrium) and establish both existence and welfare properties. The warm-glow equilibrium concept may prove to be very useful to the normative and positive theory of public goods provision. First, it is a price-based mechanism achieving efficient outcomes. Second, not only could the warm-glow equilibria outcomes serve as a point of reference to measure free-riding and welfare loss but also, as suggested by Bernheim and Rangel (Behavioral Economics and Its Applications, 2007), in large economies they may be approximated by Walrasian equilibria outcomes.},

An impact philanthropist is someone who wants to personally ‘make a difference.’ While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist’s charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor’s contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general equilibrium model in which private commodities are allocated through competitive markets and public commodities according to government allocation and taxing rules that depend on information communicated to the government by consumers regarding their preferences. A wide range of strategic behavior for consumers in their communication with the government is allowed; in particular, consumers may understate their preferences and be "free riders" if they choose. Although several examples of allocation-taxation schemes falling within the general model are discussed, the major contribution of the paper is the formulation of a particular government allocation-taxation scheme for which the behavioral equilibria are Pareto optimal. That is, given the government rules, consumers find it in their self-interest to reveal their true preferences for public goods.},

	abstract = {Public goods and common-pool resources are fundamental features of biological and social systems, and pose core challenges in achieving sustainability; for such situations, the immediate interests of individuals and the societies in which they are embedded are in potential conflict, involving game-theoretic considerations whose resolution need not serve the collective good. Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas—e.g., in bacterial biofilms—in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions that maintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon,” and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.},

The paper reviews the literature on the unique attributes of non-profit organizations (NPOs) as compared to business and/or public organizations. It shows that this literature is not dealing in detail with the unique organizational attributes of NPOs and proposes ways to do that. It identifies four organizational sub-systems where unique attributes can find their expression: (1) service delivery; (2) governance; (3) participants/workforce; (4) resourcing. It then links this literature to the literature on the Third/non-profit Sector and its unique societal roles. The paper suggests that in order for Third Sector organizations to fulfill their unique societal role of contribution to civil society, the structure of their sub-systems and their management patterns should provide opportunities for participatory practices.},

The latter is achieved by modeling precisely the idea of an economy with “many more” agents than commodities. For such an economy the existence of a competitive equilibrium is proved.

The mathematical tools and properties for this theory have developed over time to accommodate and incorporate developments in economic theory, from multiple markets and economic agents to theories of production. Yves Balasko offers an extensive, up-to-date look at the standard theory of general equilibrium, to which he has been a major contributor. This book explains how the equilibrium manifold approach can be usefully applied to the general equilibrium model, from basic consumer theory and exchange economies to models with private ownership of production. Balasko examines properties of the standard general equilibrium model that are beyond traditional existence and optimality. He applies the theory of smooth manifolds and mappings to the multiplicity of equilibrium solutions and related discontinuities of market prices. The economic concepts and differential topology methods presented in this book are accessible, clear, and relevant, and no prior knowledge of economic theory is necessary. General Equilibrium Theory of Value offers a comprehensive foundation for the most current models of economic theory and is ideally suited for graduate economics students, advanced undergraduates in mathematics, and researchers in the field.},

We present a model in which the object of altruism is a large number of potential recipients of a good for which there is a target level of provision (e.g. an acute malnutrition treatment, an insecticide-treated bed net). We show that in this case donors may measure the value of a contribution with reference to the impact that such contribution has on additional recipients, not with reference to the impact on the total level of an organization's charitable resources as traditionally assumed. In this situation, the equilibrium involves no free riding whatsoever. Equilibria that do involve free riding are characterized by provision of the target level of the charitable good to all potential recipients.},

One way to reduce these costs could be to encourage delegation of giving decisions to better-informed others. At the same time, because it involves a loss of agency, delegating these decisions may reduce one’s charitable impulse. Unfortunately, the importance of agency in charitable decisions remains largely unexplored. In this paper we shed light on this issue using a laboratory experiment with real donations in which we systematically vary the monetary and agency costs associated with making informed and effective giving decisions,. Our main finding is that agency seems to play a small role in promoting giving. In particular, people do not reduce donations when giving decisions are made by algorithms that guarantee efficient recipients but limit donors’ control over giving recipients. Moreover, we find that participating in giving groups - a weaker form of delegated giving -is also effective in that they are appealing to donors who would not otherwise make informed donations, and thus improves overall effective giving. Our results suggest that one path to promoting effective giving may be to create institutions that facilitate delegated generosity.},

Most subjects simultaneously gave to multiple charities with similar missions even when the social benefit of gifts to different charities were not equal, as proxied by the matching rates applied to subjects' gifts. Taking each subject's preferences over the set of charities as given, these choices resulted in substantial inefficiencies: subjects forfeited social surplus (matching funds) equal to 25\% of the value of their gifts. Suggestive evidence indicates that warm glow utility derived from the act of making a gift, which can lead to a love of variety even among similar charities, and risk aversion over the social value of charitable gifts are both important factors motivating donors who make socially inefficient gifts. Additionally, few subjects were willing to pay for information that could have enabled them to increase the social benefit of their gifts, although many of these subjects also forfeited potential personal gains in an investment decision, casting some doubt on this interpretation. The possibility that the personal value of information might not be equal to the social value might help explain why there are so few rigorous evaluations of aid programs: such evaluations are costly to charities and might not be valued by donors.},

In effect, nonprofit firms are barred from having owners. Rather, the two attributes of ownership – control and the right to residual earnings – must be placed in different hands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The advantage offered by the nonprofit form is that, in some circumstances, it may offer consumers of an organization's services greater protection from exploitation than they would enjoy if the organization were organized as a profit-seeking business organization, such as a partnership or an incorporated joint stock company. The nondistribution constraint makes it difficult for the organization's managers to profit by providing fewer or worse services than they promise to deliver.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Although the overhead ratio might measure top-heaviness, we argue that it does not measure nonprofit efficiency. To investigate this, we use financial and operational data to rank the efficiency of Habitat for Humanity affiliates with the overhead and administrative ratio, as well as data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), two of the most popular efficiency measures. While the DEA and SFA rankings are statistically correlated, overhead ratio rankings are negatively correlated with both SFA and DEA rankings. We argue that nonprofit scholars, managers, and donors should move away from concepts and measures of efficiency based on financial ratios, and toward ones that embrace maximizing what nonprofits are able to make and do.},

The present article represents the economic valuation of the Landscape Development and Protection Area of Volčji Potok, which is an important Slovenian cultural landscape area with internationally recognized qualities. For this purpose we combined classical contingent valuation with a closed-version of discrete choice method, where the protest responses have been removed. By using econometric analysis we obtained the value of willingness-to-pay and established its determinants. We also made an attempt to control for different biases that arise in such analyses. At last, we used the adjusted average individual value of willingness-to-pay to calculate the aggregate willingness-to-pay. The present analysis represents one of the very few applications of the method to Central and Eastern European countries.},

These results are extended to discontinuous large generalized games assuming that only payoff functions are subject to perturbations. We apply our results in an electoral game with a continuum of Cournot-Nash equilibria, where the unique essential equilibrium is that only politically engaged players participate in the electoral process. In addition, employing our results for discontinuous games, we determine the stability properties of competitive prices in large economies.},

	isbn = {9781400869473},
	abstract = {Can every allocation in the core of an economy be decentralized by a suitably chosen price system? Werner Hildenbrand shows that the answer is yes if the economy has "many" participating agents and if the influence of every individual agent on collective actions is "negligible." To give a general and precise definition of economics with this property he considers both economies with a continuum of agents, and a sequence of economies with an increasing number of participants. In both cases this leads to a measure theoretic formulation of economic equilibrium analysis.In the first part of the book the relevant mathematics is developed. In the second part the continuity and convexity properties of the total demand of a consumption sector are investigated. An important result is the equivalence between the core and the set of Walras equilibria for an exchange economy with a continuum of agents. The author then deals with limit theorems on the core for purely competitive sequences of exchange economies. In the last chapter the core and the set of Walras equilibria for a coalition production economy and the relation between these two equilibrium concepts are studied.Originally published in 1974.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

We estimate that the current Bitcoin scheme generates a large welfare loss of 1.4\% of consumption. This welfare loss can be lowered substantially to 0.08\% by adopting an optimal design that reduces mining and relies exclusively on money growth rather than transaction fees to finance mining rewards. We also point out that cryptocurrencies can potentially challenge retail payment systems provided scaling limitations can be addressed.},

The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb’s entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8\%–10\% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms—enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.},

Probability theory is a 'difficult' but productive marriage of mathemat ical abstraction and everyday intuition, and we have attempted to exhibit this fact. Thus we may appear at times to be obsessively careful in our presentation of the material, but our experience has shown that many students find them selves quite handicapped because they have never properly come to grips with the subtleties of the definitions and mathematical structures that form the foun dation of the field. Also, students may find many of the examples and problems to be computationally challenging, but it is our belief that one of the fascinat ing aspects of prob ability theory is its ability to say something concrete about the world around us, and we have done our best to coax the student into doing explicit calculations, often in the context of apparently elementary models. The practical applications of probability theory to various scientific fields are far-reaching, and a specialized treatment would be required to do justice to the interrelations between prob ability and any one of these areas. However, to give the reader a taste of the possibilities, we have included some examples, particularly from the field of statistics, such as order statistics, Dirichlet distri butions, and minimum variance unbiased estimation.},

Moreover, our approach allows for more general consumption sets than the positive cone and following the direction introduced by Podczeck (1998), the uniform substitutability assumptions of Mas-Colell (1975), Jones (1983), and Ostroy and Zame (1994), are replaced by the weaker assumptions of uniform properness.},

	abstract = {Background A variety of studies have demonstrated gains in cognitive ability following cognitive training interventions. However, other studies have not shown such gains, and questions remain regarding the efficacy of specific cognitive training interventions. Cognitive training research often involves programs made up of just one or a few exercises, targeting limited and specific cognitive endpoints. In addition, cognitive training studies typically involve small samples that may be insufficient for reliable measurement of change. Other studies have utilized training periods that were too short to generate reliable gains in cognitive performance. Methods The present study evaluated an online cognitive training program comprised of 49 exercises targeting a variety of cognitive capacities. The cognitive training program was compared to an active control condition in which participants completed crossword puzzles. All participants were recruited, trained, and tested online (N = 4,715 fully evaluable participants). Participants in both groups were instructed to complete one approximately 15-minute session at least 5 days per week for 10 weeks. Results Participants randomly assigned to the treatment group improved significantly more on the primary outcome measure, an aggregate measure of neuropsychological performance, than did the active control group (Cohen’s d effect size = 0.255; 95\% confidence interval = [0.198, 0.312]). Treatment participants showed greater improvements than controls on speed of processing, short-term memory, working memory, problem solving, and fluid reasoning assessments. Participants in the treatment group also showed greater improvements on self-reported measures of cognitive functioning, particularly on those items related to concentration compared to the control group (Cohen’s d = 0.249; 95\% confidence interval = [0.191, 0.306]). Conclusion Taken together, these results indicate that a varied training program composed of a number of tasks targeted to different cognitive functions can show transfer to a wide range of untrained measures of cognitive performance.

In contrast, relatively little research focusses on student time allocation and its effects on student performance. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of student time allocation on the average grade of undergraduate students, by gender, ability, and field of study. The results suggest that the time spent on attending courses is positively associated with grades for females, high-ability students, and students of Social Sciences and Sciences/Engineering. Spending time on self-study, on other study-related activities, or on working as a student assistant or tutor is positively correlated with grades for almost all students. Devoting time for attending tutorials or student work groups is negatively correlated with grades if the ability of students is below average or if they study Sciences/Engineering. Using a translog production function, the results indicate that spending time on courses, on self-study, and on other study-related activities are substitutes. However, time spent on courses and time spent on working as a student assistant or tutor are complements.},

Using proxy variables in a cross-sectional regression setting, they find a positive and significant effect of attendance and study time, with a substantially higher return on each additional hour of attendance. However, when panel data first-difference estimators are used to eliminate time-invariant individual-specific unobservables possibly correlated with regressors of interest, the attendance effect disappears, while study time substantially increases its economic impact.

Theories of school learning are consistent in pointing to the importance of variables such as ability, time (in particular, homework), quality of instruction, motivation, and academic coursework in their influence on learning. However, most investigators have not included all these variables simultaneously in investigations of school learning, and few have focused on indirect as well as direct effects. The purpose of the present paper was to determine the extent of the direct and indirect influence of each of these variables on academic achievement. Path analysis was conducted with data from the High School and Beyond study to examine the effects of these variables on the academic achievement of high school seniors. Results suggest that both ability and academic coursework have strong direct effects on achievement; motivation and quality of instruction were found to have meaningful indirect or total effects on achievement, but negligible direct effects. Surprisingly, homework had inconsistent direct effects. The results offer support for these variables as important influences on school learning, a finding which further supports their inclusion in prominent theories of school learning.},

At the heart of this exercise is the question of the time students dedicate to academic activities in competition with a whole range of other activities. In the literature, multiple candidate explanations are available that arise from models from essentially different conceptual origin. In particular, economic, sociological, and phenomenologically inspired models could provide valuable insight into the question. After a critical examination of these models on their potential for explaining time allocation, a study is reported involving a survey in higher education institutions in France. Data were analyzed using a hierarchical linear modeling approach. Results show that time allocation seems to be rooted in students’ past and current experience more than in their anticipations of the future. Implications for the value of the models in relation to the study of time allocation are discussed.},

I believe that altogether too many of the results presented herein are unknown to the active abstract analysts, and this is not as it should be. Banach space theory has much to offer the prac­ titioners of analysis; unfortunately, some of the general principles that motivate the theory and make accessible many of its stunning achievements are couched in the technical jargon of the area, thereby making it unapproachable to one unwilling to spend considerable time and effort in deciphering the jargon. With this in mind, I have concentrated on presenting what I believe are basic phenomena in Banach spaces that any analyst can appreciate, enjoy, and perhaps even use. The topics covered have at least one serious omission: the beautiful and powerful theory of type and cotype. To be quite frank, I could not say what I wanted to say about this subject without increasing the length of the text by at least 75 percent. Even then, the words would not have done as much good as the advice to seek out the rich Seminaire Maurey-Schwartz lecture notes, wherein the theory's development can be traced from its conception. Again, the treasured volumes of Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri also present much of the theory of type and cotype and are must reading for those really interested in Banach space theory.},

In particular, the model incorporates income shocks governed by a Wiener process with a mean of zero and standard deviation of unity as uncertainty. We analyze how uncertainty and population size affect the supply of public goods. Dynamic analysis shows the importance of attitude toward risk and a contrast between short-run and long-run responses to increases in uncertainty and population size. Results show that under specified conditions, escalating uncertainty reduces the long-run contributions to public goods through the stochastic accumulation of capital but it raises short-run contributions. The average contribution increases to a positive finite value by increasing the population to a certain level, but it declines toward zero if the population size is infinite. These twin results are based on the dynamic behaviors of risk-averse individuals responding to elevated risks.},

We also introduce relational notions specifying how allocation rules should respond to changes in resources (resource monotonicity), technologies (technology monotonicity), preferences (welfare domination under preference replacement), and population (population monotonicity, consistency, converse consistency). We investigate the implications of these properties, in various combinations, in the context of various models: the “classical” problem of dividing an unproduced bundle, economies with production, economies with public goods, economies with single-peaked preferences, economies with indivisible goods, and economies in which the dividend is a non-homogeneous continuum. We consider economies in which resources are owned collectively, economies in which they are owned privately, and economies in which ownership is mixed. We offer a number of characterizations of particular allocation rules.},

The author has found it unnecessary to rederive these results, since they are equally basic for many other areas of mathematics, and every beginning graduate student is likely to have made their acquaintance. Simi­ larly, the elementary facts on Hilbert and Banach spaces are widely known and are not discussed in detail in this book, which is mainly addressed to those readers who have attained and wish to get beyond the introductory level. The book has its origin in courses given by the author at Washington State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Tiibingen in the years 1958-1963. At that time there existed no reasonably complete text on topological vector spaces in English, and there seemed to be a genuine need for a book on this subject. This situation changed in 1963 with the appearance of the book by Kelley, Namioka et al. [1] which, through its many elegant proofs, has had some influence on the final draft of this manuscript. Yet the two books appear to be sufficiently different in spirit and subject matter to justify the publication of this manuscript; in particular, the present book includes a discussion of topological tensor products, nuclear spaces, ordered topological vector spaces, and an appendix on positive operators.},

Since preferences need not be monotone, the result allows for non-positive prices, and an exact equilibrium is obtained, rather than a free-disposal equilibrium.},

(Ω,A,P) is said to be saturated if it has the saturation property for every such μ. We show each of a number of desirable properties holds for every saturated probability space and fails for every non-saturated probability space. These include distributional properties of correspondences, such as convexity, closedness, compactness and preservation of upper semi-continuity, and the existence of pure strategy equilibria in games with many players. We also show that any probability space which has the saturation property for just one “good enough” measure, or which satisfies just one “good enough” instance of the desirable properties, must already be saturated. Our underlying themes are: (1) There are many desirable properties that hold for all saturated probability spaces but fail everywhere else; (2) Any probability space that out-performs the Lebesgue unit interval in almost any way at all is already saturated.},

Chapter II concentrates on measurable vector valued functions and the Bochner integral. Chapter III begins the study of the interplay among the Radon-Nikodym theorem for vector measures, operators on \$L\_1\$ and topological properties of Banach spaces. A variety of applications is given in the next chapter. Chapter V deals with martingales of Bochner integrable functions and their relation to dentable subsets of Banach spaces. Chapter VI is devoted to a measure-theoretic study of weakly compact absolutely summing and nuclear operators on spaces of continuous functions. In Chapter VII a detailed study of the geometry of Banach spaces with the Radon-Nikodym property is given. The next chapter deals with the use of Radon-Nikodym theorems in the study of tensor products of Banach spaces. The last chapter concludes the survey with a discussion of the Liapounoff convexity theorem and other geometric properties of the range of a vector measure.

The theoretical analysis shows that in an economy with an infinitely large number of donors, impurely altruistic preferences lead to either asymptotically zero or complete crowd‐out. The paper then establishes conditions on preferences that are sufficient to yield zero crowd‐out in the limit. These conditions are fairly weak and quite plausible. An empirical representation of the model is estimated using a new 1986–92 panel of donations and government funding from the United States to 125 international relief and development organizations. Besides directly linking sources of public and private support, the econometric analysis controls for unobserved institution‐specific factors, institution‐specific changes in leadership, year‐to‐year changes in need, and expenditures by related organizations. The estimates show little evidence of crowd‐out from either direct public or related private sources. Thus, at the margin, donations to these organizations appear to be motivated solely by joy‐of‐giving preferences. In addition to addressing the basic question of motives behind charitable giving, the results help explain the existing disparity between econometric and experimental crowd‐out estimates.},

The Fokker–Planck equation for the resulting drift-diffusion process implies that the stationary distribution is independent of the size of the shock so that a small-disturbance limiting distribution is well defined. We present explicit solutions for the statistical equilibrium for the cases of quasilinear and Gorman-aggregatable Cobb–Douglas economies, and illustrate the results in the context of a generic dividend-discount model to emphasize the distinction between insurable risk and unhedgeable uncertainty in this context. The statistical equilibrium of income or wealth for quasilinear economies is described by an exponential Gibbs distribution. The statistical equilibrium income and wealth distributions for Gorman-aggregatable Cobb–Douglas economies can take a wider variety of forms, including power-law and gamma distributions. The statistical equilibria calculated for these examples suggest a close relation to widely observed statistical distributional regularities in real-world economies.},

The equilibrium operates in an abstract setting built upon a concept of convexity borrowed from convex geometry. We apply the concept to a variety of convex economies and relate it to Pareto optimality. The "magic" of linear equilibrium prices is put into perspective by establishing an analogy between linear functions in the standard convexity and "primitive orderings" in the abstract convexity.

In this paper, we show that in the space of welfare weights, the set of stable equilibria and the set of no-transfer paradox equilibria coincide.

Her critique of neoclassical theory placed her at the forefront of the still raging ‘Cambridge controversy’ in capital theory. Joan Robinson’s work on capital and growth also showed a real concern that economic dynamics be studied as a process in real time. The dynamics of the stationary state might be a useful starting point, but the more serious concerns were the relationship between the short- and long-run periods in the process of accumulation and growth. She also stressed the importance of understanding the evolution of economies outside equilibrium positions.},

The reduction in trade caused by ambiguity aversion can be as severe as to lead to no trade. In an economy with MEU decision makers, we show that if the aggregate endowment is unanimously unambiguous, then every Pareto optima allocation is also unambiguous. We also characterize the situation in which every unanimously unambiguous allocation is Pareto optimal. Finally, we show how our results can be used to explain the home-bias effect. As a useful result for our methods, we also obtain an additivity theorem for CEU and MEU decision makers that does not require comonotonicity.},

In contrast, experiments with the triadic design do discriminate between transfers resulting from trust or reciprocity and transfers resulting from other-regarding preferences that are not conditional on the behavior of others.

uncertainty is another person rather than nature. Individuals in six countries
(Brazil, China, Oman, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States) confronted
a binary-choice trust game or a risky decision offering the same payoffs and
probabilities. Risk acceptance was calibrated by asking individuals their "minimum
acceptable probability" (MAP) for securing the high payoff that would
make them willing to accept the risky rather than the sure payoff. People's
MAPs are generally higher when another person, rather than nature, determines
the outcome. This indicates betrayal aversion. (JEL C72, D81, Z13)},

Participants in a binary trust game (they could either keep \$5 for sure or give it to a trustee with the chance of getting \$10 back) were informed that their chance of interacting with a trustworthy person was either 46 percent or 80 percent and then were asked to decide whether to trust that other person. In addition, participants made a decision in a lottery (i.e., whether to gamble \$5 to win \$10) with the same probabilities. In the 46 percent condition, participants were significantly more willing to choose the risky option in the trust game than in the lottery. Overall, the difference in probability of receiving money back had a significantly higher impact on the lottery decision than on the decision to trust.

We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies.},

Similar to certain arrangements in the market for bank loans, household borrowing is restricted by a household-specific wealth dependent upper bound on credit lines in all states of uncertainty in the second period. We first establish that, generically in the set of the economies, equilibria exist and are finite and regular. We then show that equilibria are generically suboptimal. Finally, we provide a robust example demonstrating that the equilibrium allocations can be Pareto improved through a tightening of the participation constraints. This suggests, contrary to what is often cited as economic wisdom in the popular press, that in a setting with frictions resulting in an inefficient allocation the regulation of markets may have a Pareto-improving effect on the economy.},

Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns.

In an initially all-white neighborhood, real estate brokers thus either keep the neighborhood in a steady-state white equilibrium or trigger racial transition by matching sellers to minority buyers, a process called blockbusting. Racial transition leads to a higher rate of property turnover in the neighborhood once the fraction of minorities has reached a tipping point—but racial transition also leads to lower prices, and this is the trade-off faced by a broker. The model shows that with multiple brokers, blockbusting profit per broker is lower as brokers free ride on each other's groundbreaking efforts. The model predicts that racial transition will happen in the neighborhood when (i) the number of brokers is limited, (ii) racial preferences lie in an intermediate range, (iii) the arrival rate of offers is intermediate. Otherwise, real estate brokers steer white households toward white buyers.},

We investigate how to computationally implement a recently-proposed theoretical solution to this problem (Budish, 2009) which uses approximate competitive equilibria to balance notions of efficiency, fairness, and incentives. Despite the apparent similarity to the well-known combinatorial auction problem we show that no polynomial-size mixed-integer program (MIP) can solve our problem. Instead, we develop a two-level search process: at the master level, the center uses tabu search over the union of two distinct neighborhoods to suggest prices; at the agent level, we use MIPs to solve for student demands in parallel at the current prices. Our method scales near-optimally in the number of processors used and is able to solve realistic-size problems fast enough to be usable in practice.},

The motivation for individuals to found and operate such firms is that it allows them to influence the mix of public goods. It is their decisions regarding the allocation of donations across uses that matter in the end. Donors to these firms take into account the allocation decisions that will be made by the organizations to which they contribute. We find a propensity for such organizations to specialize in the provision of services, and further find that diversification by such firms diminishes the equilibrium level of contributions they will collect. We demonstrate the possibility that a commitment by a monopoly charity to an allocation rule that is, ex-post, privately sub-optimal can eliminate this effect, and may therefore be advantageous, ex-ante. The allocation rule which accomplishes this involves honouring donor designations of their contributions to specific uses. This is a policy that is frequently adopted by local chapters of the United Way.},

This paper argues that the opposite direction of causality is more plausible, i.e. that populations with higher trust levels are more prone to creating and successfully maintaining universal welfare states with high levels of taxation where publicly financed social insurance schemes. The hypothesis is tested using instrumental variable techniques to infer variations in trust levels that pre-date current welfare states, and then using the variation in historical trust levels to explain the current size and design of the welfare state, and finally comparing the explanatory power of trust to other potential explanatory factors such as left-right ideology and economic openness. To infer variation about historical trust levels, we use three instruments, all used previously in the trust literature: the grammatical rule allowing pronoun-drop, average temperature in the coldest month and a dummy for constitutional monarchies. Using cross-sectional data for 77 countries, we show that these instruments are valid and that countries with higher historical trust levels have significantly higher public expenditure as a share of GDP and also have more regulatory freedom. This finding is robust to controlling for several other potential explanations of welfare state size.},

The ICP, which can be computed at any desired level of aggregation, refers to the probability that an individual can communicate with a randomly selected person in the society based on common languages. The estimated two-level hierarchical models show that, however, individual level communication potential does not seem to impact trust formation, but living in an area with higher average communication potential increases the chance of exhibiting higher trust toward unknown people.},

We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibria to be Pareto efficient and show that when collateral is scarce equilibria are not only Pareto inefficient but also often constrained inefficient, in the sense that imposing tighter borrowing restrictions can make everybody in the economy better off.

We apply this perspective to an exchange economy where equilibrium prices and individual endowments are observable. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize the equilibrium prices, as functions of initial endowments. Furthermore, we show that, if these conditions are satisfied, then the economy can generically be identified. Finally, we show that when only aggregate data are available, observable restrictions vanish.

The use of Aubin coalitions allows us to connect results with the arbitrage free condition due to non-linear supporting prices. The use of rational allocations allows us to dispense with Lyapunov convexity theorem. Applications are provided in connection with strategic market games and economies with asymmetric information.},

In the general case, f is a subadditive Choquet integral if and only if it satisfies the three previous properties, together with sup-norm continuity. This result provides another characterization of subadditive Choquet integrals different from the seminal paper by Schmeidler (Proc Am Math Soc 97(2):255–261, 1986) that relies on comonotonic additivity.},

This is in particular the case when data result from large-scale sampling with incomplete observations. This study is concerned with the effect of conditioning on such situations. The natural conditioning rule is here the Bayesian rule: there exists a posterior probability after the observation of event E, and it is known to be located in P E, the set of conditionals of the members of P. An explicit expression for the Möbius transform φE of f E in terms of φ, the transform of f, is found and Fagin and Halpern’s earlier finding that the lower envelope f E of P E is itself a belief function is derived from it. However, f E no longer characterizes P E (not all probabilities dominating f E belong to it), unless f satisfy further stringent conditions that are both necessary and sufficient. The difficulties resulting from this fact are discussed and suggestions to cope with them are made.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

	abstract = {When financial investors’ portfolio holdings are unconstrained, financial economies are assumed, w.l.o.g., to have no redundant assets. Indeed, eliminating redundant assets allows to replace the initial financial structure by an equivalent one, i.e., one that has the same consumption equilibria. Moreover, at the end of the process, absence of redundant assets guarantees that the set of admissible portfolio allocations is bounded, a fundamental property for the existence of equilibria. In the presence of institutional (exogenous) portfolio constraints, eliminating redundant assets is not innocuous anymore since bounded arbitrage may persist at equilibrium, the law of one price does not hold, and some zero-income portfolios may not be free. The goal of the paper is to replace the elimination of redundant assets by the elimination of useless portfolios, a process that eliminates in particular Werner useless portfolios, but needs to go beyond to obtain the boundedness of the set of admissible portfolio allocations at the end of the purification process. Moreover, the elimination process is carried out without affecting the set of consumption equilibria, hence replacing at each step the financial structure by an equivalent one.},

However, can such improved models yield improved student learning? This paper reports positively on progress in closing this loop. We demonstrate that a tutor unit, redesigned based on data-driven cognitive model improvements, helped students reach mastery more efficiently. In particular, it produced better learning on the problem-decomposition planning skills that were the focus of the cognitive model improvements.},

Our main result characterizes those pricing rules C that are super-replication prices of a frictionless and arbitrage-free incomplete asset structure with a bond. This characterization relies on the equivalence between the sets of frictionless securities and securities priced by C. The former captures securities without bid-ask spreads, while the second captures the class of securities where, if some of its delivers is replaced by a higher payoff, then the resulting security is characterized by a higher value priced by C. We also analyze the special case of pricing rules associated with securities markets admitting a structure of basic assets paying one in some event and nothing otherwise. In this case, we show that the pricing rule can be characterized in terms of capacities. This Arrow–Debreu ambiguous state price can be viewed as a generalization for incomplete markets of Arrow–Debreu state price valuation. Also, some interesting cases are given by pricing rules determined by an integral w.r.t. a risk-neutral capacity. For instance, incomplete markets of Arrow securities and a bond are revealed by a Choquet integral w.r.t. a special risk-neutral capacity.},

The example is a two-period securities model with a three-dimensional portfolio space and two traders. The paper identifies a non-marketed call option that fails to have a minimum cost super-replicating portfolio. Using this option, we construct an economy that satisfies all of Mas-Colell's assumptions, except that the three-dimensional commodity space is not a vector lattice. In this economy, there is no Walrasian equilibrium and the second theorem of welfare economics fails.

Our example has important finite- as well as infinite-dimensional implications. It is also an example of a “well behaved” economy in which optimal allocations that are not supported by linear Walrasian prices are decentralized by the non-linear prices studied in Aliprantis–Tourky–Yannelis (2001).},

	abstract = {Using a change in the rules of EU food aid policy in 1996, I investigate how donor countries react to EU’s food aid allocation. Taking advantage of the phase-in period of the reform I find that donors have two different reactions depending on the size of the recipients. On average if the EU stops allocating food aid to a small country, this reduces by 1.4 the average number of other donors. On the contrary, if the EU stops allocating to a large country, this increases by 0.3 the average number of other donors. I also observe differences between EU members and other countries. Next, I develop a simple theoretical framework in which donors react to EU’s action either indirectly because it changes the recipient’s needs or directly because they are motivated by comparing with their allocation with the EU. I derive a donor typology from the theoretical framework. Donors are motivated by direct comparison with the EU allocation in the case of small countries and by recipient’s characteristics for large countries.},

Gains from cooperation are represented by a valuation which maps coalition structures into payoff vectors. I show that any core stable coalition structure can be attained as a stationary perfect equilibrium of the game. If stationary perfect equilibria may fail to exist in general games, a simple condition is provided under which they exist in symmetric games. Furthermore, symmetric stationary perfect equilibria of symmetric games generate a coalition structure which is generically unique up to a permutation of the players. A general method for the characterization of equilibria in symmetric games is proposed and applied to the formation of cartels in oligopolies and coalitions in symmetric majority games.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers : C78, C71.},

An elaboration on the Shapley value that assigns, to characteristic function games, a “partition function” outcome is broadly established and accepted, but elaborations to encompass games with externalities (represented by partition functions) are not. Here, I show that simultaneous consideration of the two elaborations (“generalization” and “extension”) obtains a unique Shapley-type value for games in partition function form. The key requirement is that the “Extended, Generalized Shapley Value” (EGSV) should be “recursive”: the EGSV of any game should be the EGSV of itself. This requirement forces us to ignore all but the payoffs to bilateral partitions. The EGSV can be conceptualized as the ex ante value of a process of successive bilateral amalgamations. Previous Shapley value extensions, if generalized, are not recursive; indeed, they iterate to the EGSV.},

	abstract = {When environmental externalities are international — i.e. transfrontier — they most often are multilateral and embody public good characteristics. Improving upon inefficient laissez-faire equilibria requires voluntary cooperation for which the game-theoretic core concept provides optimal outcomes that have interesting properties against free riding. To define the core, however, the characteristic function of the game associated with the economy (which specifies the payoff achievable by each possible coalition of players—here, the countries) must also reflect in each case the behavior of the players which are not members of the coalition. This has been for a long time a disputed issue in the theory of the core of economies with externalities.Among the several assumptions that can be made as to this behaviour, a plausible one is defined in this paper, for which it is shown that the core of the game is nonempty. The proof is constructive in the sense that it exhibits a strategy (specifying an explicit coordinated abatement policy and including financial transfers) that has the desired property of nondomination by any proper coalition of countries, given the assumed behavior of the other countries. This strategy is also shown to have an equilibrium interpretation in the economic model.},

In this paper, we develop an integrated model of production in the presence of capital asset market equilibrium. Our theory indicates that, in a stochastic environment, production and financial variables are inextricably interrelated. Following the financial equilibrium models of Sharpe, Lintner, and Mossin, we assume that profits and therefore portfolio returns are random. But stockholders can alter their distributions of returns by altering firms' production decisions as well as by altering their portfolios. The key to the analysis is a "unanimity theorem," which shows that in many environments stockholders will agree on optimal output decisions, despite their different expectations and attitudes towards risk. We develop equilibrium conditions which must be satisfied by production decisions. Profit maximization is indeed optimal for a firm whose profits are riskless. But risky firms' outputs depend on financial as well as cost variables, and the equilibrium conditions lead to a theory of production under uncertainty which replaces the now-vacuous notion of profit maximization. We further show that the output decisions will be Pareto optimal for stockholders, and that these decisions maximize market value only in a "purely competitive" world. Our results provide a synthesis of the conflicting conclusions of Diamond, Stiglitz, and Wilson on the optimality of stock markets.},

	abstract = {In this paper, labour contracts are examined in the context of a general stock market economy where all shareholders are risk averse, and firms act in shareholders interest. The problem considered is whether some firm can offer a wage contract that will make all its shareholders better off. We show by example that, contrary to the arguments in the partial equilibrium framework, it is possible that no such contract will exist, even when there are potential gains to risk sharing. A sufficient condition for the existence of a feasible pareto improving contract is given. It is shown that contract trading will arise provided some firm has no large shareholders.},

In this paper we propose an objective for firms to pursue which is a generalization of the idea of profit maximization. We show that, if firms' managers can transfer current income between shareholders at the first date, and if shareholders have what we call competitive perceptions concerning the effect of a change in production plan on share prices, then each firm will maximize a weighted sum of shareholders' private valuations of the firm's production plan, where the weights are the initial shareholdings. We then define, and prove the existence of, a competitive equilibrium in which firms pursue this proposed objective. Finally, we analyze the optimality properties of the competitive equilibrium.},

The algorithm indexes individuals according to their free-riding levels of the public good. This level is finite for an individual whose donation is always dictated by some altruism or concern for charity. We show that if all individuals have finite free-riding levels, then the crowding-out is complete in a large economy. If, on the other hand, a non-negligible fraction of the population never free rides, then the crowding-out is zero in a large economy. We discuss implications of these extreme crowding-out predictions for charitable behavior and fund-raising strategies.},

The volume ranking has strange properties and cannot be justified by unit invariance and symmetry. The pointed distance (of the budget hyperplane from the origin along some line) provides a measure or ranking that coincides with the standard “purchasing power” or real income. The linear price index is practically unavoidable for measuring or ranking freedom. This is applied to the determination of income distribution and taxation implied by the equal freedom of choice of different domains. Concepts of equal or compared potential freedoms and utility-freedom relate freedom analysis to the basic classical concepts of fair allocation (equity-no-envy, egalitarian equivalence, etc.). The crucial difference between the two opposite concepts of invariance in comparisons is emphasized.},

The probabilities that offers to workers of different types produce a hire are treated parametrically by firms who have correct expectations about them, and firms forego the wage when they extend an offer whether the offer is successful or not. In a general framework, we prove that equilibria exist.},

In particular, firms with high-growth opportunities tend to obtain listings on stock exchanges with high listing standards. We empirically examine these predictions and find that they are consistent with evidence.},

In addition, little is known about the factors that influence an exchange's decision to demutualize. Utilizing data on 11 out of 20 demutualized stock exchanges during the period 1996–2008, we find that: (1) demutualization increases an exchange's financial performance, size, and liquidity, while lowers its debt; (2) a stock exchange with relatively large size has relatively low profitability and high debt; (3) an exchange with relatively large size, low debt and high value of trade is more likely to demutualize. We conclude that stock exchange conversion from mutual to demutualized exchange is value enhancing for the exchange and its shareholders.},

We distinguish financial intermediaries according to whether they issue complete contingent contracts or incomplete contracts. Intermediaries such as banks that issue incomplete contracts, e.g., demand deposits, are subject to runs, but this does not imply a market failure. A sophisticated financial system—a system with complete markets for aggregate risk and limited market participation—is incentive-efficient, if the intermediaries issue complete contingent contracts, or else constrained-efficient, if they issue incomplete contracts. We argue that there may be a role for regulating liquidity provision in an economy in which markets for aggregate risks are incomplete.},

To make the model tractable, I use the Azevedo and Leshno (2013) framework, in which a finite number of firms is matched to a continuum of workers.

In equilibrium, even if wages are exogenous and fixed, firms have incentives to strategically reduce their capacity, to increase the quality of their worker pool. The intensity of incentives to reduce capacity is given by a simple formula, analogous to the classic Cournot model, but depends on different moments of the distribution of preferences. I compare markets with uniform and personalized wages. For fixed quantities, markets with personalized wages always yield higher efficiency than markets with uniform wages, but may be less efficient if firms reduce capacity to avoid bidding too much for star workers.},

Thus the consolidation of European exchanges into one may occur with a welfare-efficient outcome or with a lock-in to a Pareto-inferior equilibrium, due to the network externalities and the different starting points of the various exchanges. ‘Implicit mergers’ among exchanges together with remote access are always weakly (in half of the cases, strictly) more efficient than the actual competition. This finding also sheds light on the existence and efficacy, of ATS and rating agencies, which can be viewed respectfully as exchanges specialising in trading and listing services.},

The profitability ratios of the ASX have significantly improved in the five years following the demutualization and self-listing. The performance improvements remain significant even after controlling for growth in the Australian economy. From a market quality perspective, we document evidence of increased trading activity by foreign investors after ASX’s demutualization and self-listing. Interestingly, we also find that bid-ask spreads of the stock market have narrowed in the post-conversion period. In particular, small-cap firms have become more liquid. The results show that stock exchange conversion from mutual to publicly traded exchange is not only value enhancing for the exchange and its shareholders, but it is also beneficial for the stock market as a whole.},

The NYSE's recent mergers with Archipelago and Euronext bring questions about the viability and effects of competition between stock exchanges to the policy forefront. We examine the largely forgotten but unparalleled episode of competition between the NYSE and the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York (Consolidated) from 1885 to 1926. The Consolidated averaged 23\% of NYSE volume for approximately forty years by operating a second market for the most liquid securities that traded on the Big Board. Our results suggest that NYSE bid-ask spreads fell by more than 10\% when the Consolidated began to trade NYSE stocks and subsequently increased when the Consolidated ceased operations.

	abstract = {This paper builds a general equilibrium model of finite economies with exchange and club formation. Agents trade multiple private goods widely in the market, can belong to several clubs, and care about the characteristics of other club members. Because club memberships are indivisible and choices of club memberships must be coordinated across the population, the core of such an economy may be empty and equilibrium may not exist. However, for large finite club economies, an approximate core is not empty and states in this approximate core can be approximately decentralized by prices for private goods and for club memberships. The arguments use convexification tools familiar from the literature on private goods economies and a new tool, of some independent interest, that addresses the special problems created by the nature of club memberships.

Notions of price-taking equilibrium and the core, both with communication costs, are introduced. These notions take into account that there is a small communication cost of deviating from a given outcome. We demonstrate that, given communication costs, for all sufficiently large economies the core is nonempty and the set of price-taking equilibrium outcomes is equivalent to the core.},

Small groups are effective if all or almost all gains to collective activities can be realized by cooperation restricted to them. At this point, there are many papers in the literature demonstrating the competitiveness of club and coalition economies in a variety of contexts. To facilitate the exposition, I treat economies with quasi-linear utilities and games with side payments. The main concepts and results for this framework are discussed. Additionally, relationships are established with regard to broader models of club and coalition economies, including very recent contributions to the literature.},

	abstract = {Does competition among financial intermediaries lead to excessively low standards? To examine this question, we construct a model where intermediaries design contracts to attract trading volume, taking into consideration that traders differ in credit quality and may default. When credit quality is observable, intermediaries demand the "right" amount of guarantees. A monopolist would demand fewer guarantees. Private information about credit quality has an ambiguous effect in a competitive environment. When the cost of default is large (small), private information leads to higher (lower) standards. We exhibit examples where private information is present and competition produces higher standards than monopoly does.},

	abstract = {We study financial markets where agents share risks, but have incentives to default and their financial positions might not be transparent, that is, might not be mutually observable. We show that a lack of position transparency results in a counterparty risk externality, that manifests itself in the form of excess “leverage,” in that parties take on short positions that lead to levels of default risk that are higher than Pareto efficient ones. This externality is absent when trading is organized via a centralized clearing mechanism that provides transparency of trade positions. Collateral requirements and especially subordination of non-transparent positions in bankruptcy can ameliorate the counterparty risk externality in market settings such as over-the-counter (OTC) markets which feature a lack of position transparency.},

	doi = {10.1093/oxrep/12.4.53},
	abstract = {Many securities exchanges are run as members' cooperatives: they are run on behalf of the people who use the exchange. This form of governance is unusual. Most businesses have outside ownership: the people who own and run the firm are typically not the same people who buy and use the firm's product. That is, contrast to a members' cooperative, ownership is not bundled with the right to consume. We argue that the crucial distinction between a cooperative structure and outside ownership concerns who has residual rights or control over the non-human assets. With outside ownership, control rests with the owners; and since outside owners are typically only interested in maximizing profit, they tend to make inefficient decisions, tailored to the marginal user. By contrast, in a cooperative the members have collective control. Collective decision making is typically inefficient, because in a vote the views of the pivotal voter are not necessarily the same as those of the membership as a whole. Thus both forms of governance, outside ownership and a members' cooperative are inefficient - but for different reasons, and in different ways. In comparing the two ownership structures, we find that outside ownership becomes relatively more efficient than a members' cooperative as: (i) the variation across the membership becomes more skewed; and (ii) the exchange faces more competition. For many exchanges, but these changes have occurred in recent years. However, even if outside ownership is now the superior structure of governance for an exchange, a members' cooperative may not, of its volition, vote in favour of making the change; i.e. they may decide not to sell up. This is because the gainers may be unable to compensate the losers.},
